There was hooks on the roof, kind of ancher points where you hang ropes off and do the windows, and they charge them for like, whatever. Dad was a bit, he was happy, but he was also a it sad that they'd done the job. H'd already kind of fantasised in his head about that moment. where he goes into their office and goes, "So you did sis, did you?" "Then explain this video."

* Normally, on country roads, if you see a radar gun as you keep going along, you flash your headlights to the oncoming cars. "Just so you know", they could pin you up there. I feel like there is a type of flash they should be doing. Bec, did this: flash-flash. and I'm this flash pause flash. I think I go with Bec. really? that seems panicky. no. the whole point of this is, it's conspiratorial. like the same way that you do a quick wink to someone if it's 'message received' and it's fast. That's how pros do it. Going up to someone doing slow wink, that's how babies do it. Unfortunately, you do it a really weird way that no one agrees with it. If you did long flashes and I was oncoming, I would think you're tyring to turn on your lights and you don't know how. I'd think you're brand new to the car.
* oncoming
