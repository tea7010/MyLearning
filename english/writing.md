## My opinion

* https://japantoday.com/category/national/tokyo-trains-ask-people-to-refrain-from-wearing-halloween-costumes-that-may-scare-other-passengers
    * The company has to make an announcemnt of refraining frightenning costume on the train not to repeat the last year incidents.
    * I think this kind of announcement that prohibit wear a scared cosutume on the train wouldn't be a direct countermeasure of the incidents. I think those who are desparate people would commit a violence whatever the costume is, and wouldn't mind whether it's prohibited or not. I believe having a opportunity or advice is the most important thing to reduce such desparate violence.

So I think the govenment should consider to a law like taking the driving liscence forcely from the people who is over 80 and give some free ticket of public transportations. I might be a little unfriendly society, but I believe it would be more important to save younger people who are now supporting Japan from the fatal accidents dirived by older people.

Start from understanding the basic guitar structure and the knowledge like the strings name to move up to the next level, Until get the idea and concept of improvision of jazz, fusion and progressive genre. As he mentioned there are not so many youtube videos that explain the roadmap or comprehensive way to learn music and the guitar. I thought some recommendations of songs to practice are a bit too far since it is up to the learners to decide what songs they want to learn. However, IT appears that learning and understanding the music theory by heart with lots of experience and technical or phsical ability to play songs are essentials to get ahead on next level.
    * This video delineated the progression of guitar learning, spanning from novice to advanced levels, represented by a scale from zero to six. It commences with acquainting oneself with the fundamental structure of the guitar and understanding elements such as string names, progressing gradually to more complex concepts. Eventually, it delves into the realms of jazz, fusion, and progressive genres, elucidating the intricacies of improvisation. The presenter highlighted the scarcity of comprehensive YouTube tutorials outlining such a roadmap for music and guitar education. While they offered song recommendations for practice, it was underscored that learners have the autonomy to choose songs aligned with their preferences. However, the crux of advancement lies in mastering music theory, coupled with ample experience and the technical prowess necessary for playing diverse compositions.

    * this video delineated how to become a more efficient learner. He highlighted four points and I have already forgetting two of them, but I remember those are like, keep your brain sharp(sleep well, keep health), learn actively rather than passively, stay focused(not being buzz by smartphones), and rephrase what you learned with different words or your own expressions.
    * In the video, the presenter outlined strategies for enhancing learning efficiency. While I recall only two out of the four points, they emphasized the importance of maintaining cognitive sharpness through adequate sleep and prioritizing health. Additionally, they advocated for active engagement in the learning process, emphasizing focus over passivity and minimizing distractions such as smartphone interruptions. Another key strategy highlighted was the practice of rephrasing learned material using one's own words or expressions, reinforcing comprehension and retention.
* Blues Guitar lesson
    * This series of the videos sounds like good for me to learn basic the "soul" of blues guitar through practicing a simple lyrics. As written in the title, it is for intermediate guitar player, so it doesn't explan the fundamental things like the position of minor pentatonic scale, which I felt this video is adequate level for me. The first lecture out of 27 lessons was about the blues scale that has extra flat fifth on top of minor pentatonic. Also, quarter bending is also highlighted through practicing a riff. 
    * "This video series is perfect for me to learn the basics and the essence of blues guitar through practicing simple lyrics. As stated in the title, it is designed for intermediate guitar players, so it doesn't cover fundamental topics like the minor pentatonic scale positions, which makes it an appropriate level for me. The first lesson out of 27 focuses on the blues scale, which includes an extra flat fifth in addition to the minor pentatonic notes. It also emphasizes quarter bending while practicing a riff."
    * The part2 was about the code progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G, the forth(C) and fifth(D) are used for the code. It sounds natural and smooth or feel like surfing on the wave to change the using pentatonic scale by progression of the code. That's the same theory or typical way the same as Jazz. However, I found out that I need to work on the quick vibrart in terms of phsical practice.
    * Part 2 was about the chord progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G; the fourth (C) and fifth (D) chords are used in the progression. It sounds natural and smooth, like surfing on a wave, to change the pentatonic scale according to the chord progression. This is the same theory or typical approach used in Jazz. However, I realized that I need to work on my quick vibrato technique through physical practice.
* I saw some youtube videos about how to speak English fluently. As rule of thum, I think it is essential to learn vocaburary and common expressions through contexts, but to apply the expressions in onself's daily life or soroundings is crutial to make the learnt vocaburary active in one's mind. Speaking to oneself is a good way to try to find appropriate word to match your current situation, and make your slept vocaburary awaken.

Speaking to oneself is a good way to practice finding the appropriate words to match your current situation, helping to awaken dormant vocabulary.
* Today my family and me went to Costco by my wife driving. Recently, my wife practice her driving as she hadn't driven for ages since she got a driving license when she was 24 years old. In Japan, the people who don't have much experience to drive a car but spent a lot of time without driving, is called paper driver, which means that they are supposed to be able to drive, but they can't do it practically. drivers existing only on paper (I guess it used to use as managemnent of the drivers list), they are called that ironically.
* Today, my family and I went to Costco with my wife driving. Recently, she has been practicing her driving since she hadn't driven for ages after getting her license at 24. In Japan, people who have a driver's license but little actual driving experience are called "paper drivers." This term implies that they are theoretically capable of driving but can't do it practically. The name comes from the idea that their driving skills exist only on paper, originally referring to driver management lists, and is used ironically.
* We did a bbq with my frend today. Although it was just a day before I asked him to come over my house to have bbq, he visited and had a nice bbq together. I prepared some meat like Japanese style Karubi, which is thin sliced boneless short ribs, and also a sirloin steak and some vegitables. Before I came here I hadn't liked bell peppers(capsicum) so much, however, it's now one of my fevarite vegitable(fruit technically) as the good taste when we grill on charcoal. I would like to know the other vegitables and food that I don't know yet, so I would like to have more good conversation or meals with people. We will invite more people the next time.

I prepared some meat, including Japanese-style Karubi, which is thinly sliced boneless short ribs, as well as sirloin steak and some vegetables. Before moving here, I didn't like bell peppers (capsicum) much, but now they are one of my favorite vegetables (technically fruits) because they taste so good when grilled over charcoal. I want to discover more vegetables and foods that I don't know about yet, so I look forward to having more conversations and meals with people. Next time, we will invite more friends.

    * QLD govenment dicided a almost free fare trial of public transportations that people can get on board buses, trains, and ferries just 50 cencts. Many people criticise this trial as to collect the votes for the next election and suspicious about the sustainability of the cheap fare in terms of the budget. Also, the premir enphasized the point of this is to get the people back to public transport as the same level as pre covid state, and to reduce the traffic when rush hours. Having said that, some people say that they choose the means of transportation by the quality of it rather than the price itself as some trials in other countries like newzealand turned out that they've got only a few increase in the number of people back to public transport.
    * The Queensland government has decided to trial almost-free fares for public transportation, allowing people to ride buses, trains, and ferries for just 50 cents. Many critics argue that this trial is a ploy to gather votes for the upcoming election and question the sustainability of such low fares given the budget constraints. Additionally, the Premier emphasized that the main goal is to encourage people to return to public transport to pre-COVID levels and to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours. However, some argue that people choose their mode of transportation based on quality rather than price. Similar trials in other countries, such as New Zealand, have shown only a slight increase in public transport usage.

* the complaint about the wfh display I am using is that the control buttons are pushed without touching somehow. I think it is due to some mecanically mulfunctions of circuit board or something. The odd and irritating point is that the phenomenon doesn't happen always, but sometimes. I really need to change it because it is really frustrating for me like I commerce my job, but dispalay keeps flushing or the configuration screen moving.

Recently I am really thinking to buy a thinner keyboard than the one I have now. There are two reasons why I want to swap keyboard; One is I want to keep clean and neat on my desk. The currenct mechanical keyboard is really thick and I need whlist rest board to keep my typing position and the angle of hands comfortable. To keep the desk widely and neatly by removing whist lest, I need a thinner keyboard so-called low-profile keyboard. The other reason is that I am wondering if I can use the low-profile keyboard for travel or when I work from home and want to use on laptop, so that is going to use external keyboard on laptop keyboard. Either reason, I am seeking on more portability and minimalizm.

Title: Considering a New Keyboard for a Cleaner and More Portable Setup
Lately, I've been contemplating upgrading to a thinner keyboard, and I've pinpointed two main reasons for this potential change.
Firstly, I strive to maintain a clean and neat desk. My current mechanical keyboard, while satisfying to type on, is quite thick. To maintain a comfortable typing position and angle for my hands, I need a wrist rest. The wrist rest, although useful, takes up additional space and somewhat disrupts the streamlined look I desire for my desk. By switching to a low-profile keyboard, I can eliminate the need for a wrist rest. This would help in achieving a more spacious and tidy workspace, aligning with my minimalist preferences.
Secondly, the portability factor is becoming increasingly important to me. I travel occasionally and also work from home on my laptop. Using the laptop's built-in keyboard isn’t as comfortable or efficient as I’d like. A low-profile keyboard would be lightweight and easy to carry, making it a great companion for travel. It would also provide a better typing experience when I’m working from different locations, allowing me to use an external keyboard without the bulk of my current setup.
In summary, a low-profile keyboard would not only enhance the aesthetics and functionality of my desk but also offer the portability and minimalist design that I am looking for. This would make my work setup more versatile and efficient, whether I am at home or on the go.

* I really hate to think about what to say in the meeting. Sometimes I don't have any ideas =what they are talking about and what am I suppose to say or think. I think it is because of my language skill, but other than that, I might lost interest to the topic. I am basically a bit of self satisfuction person and lose my attention when I felt it sounds boring, that making my brain stop thinking. So trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from third person's viewpoint is the key to brush up the attention to the details.
* really hate thinking about what to say in meetings. Sometimes, I have no idea what they are talking about or what I am supposed to say or think. I believe this is partly due to my language skills, but I may also lose interest in the topic. I tend to be somewhat self-satisfied and lose focus when something sounds boring, causing my mind to stop thinking. Therefore, trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from a third person's viewpoint is key to improving my attention to detail.

* I realised that I need to write and speak more and more to brush up the ability. You might afraid to remeber wrong grammer or expressions without any knowledge of them, and you stick to use the wrong expressions. It is completely wrong. Because you never notice your mistakes without trying anything. You need to try to compose sentensces with your knowledge whatever the quality is. Then you will be the first step to be aware of the area you need to work on. After several experiences you will notice that the expressions you struggled to express was something like down to the expression bra bra bra... So my message to me is just try to write down anything and speak to myself anything, and those actions are supposed to be an unconscious habit to think everything. By doing that, you will be able to a person that is storyfull and chearfull.
* I realized that I need to write and speak more to improve my English. You might be afraid of remembering incorrect grammar or expressions without knowing they are wrong, and you might end up using incorrect expressions. This is completely wrong. You will never notice your mistakes without trying. You need to try to compose sentences with your current knowledge, regardless of the quality. This is the first step to becoming aware of the areas you need to work on. After several attempts, you will notice that the expressions you struggled with become easier, and you will eventually get them right. So, my advice to myself is to just try to write and speak as much as possible. These actions should become an unconscious habit. By doing this, you will become more articulate and cheerful.

* Finnaly I bought a new keyboard, Nuphy 75, which is the version 2 model of its series. The difference between the key board that I have been using for almost 2 years and the new one is thickness. Nuphy is low-profile and it doesn't need a wrist rest on a desk. On the other hand, the one I am using now is a usual mechanical key board, which uses a chunky switch and longer travel distance in terms of pushing a switch. I wanted to bring a keyboard with my laptop and put it on the keyboard of the laptop to type and use shortcuts or key binding I want to use. I haven't gotton the percel of it yet, but I am really looking forward to using it as I even wrote about this keyboard in my diary twice.
* Finally, I bought a new keayboarad, the Nuphy 75, which is the second version of its series. The main difference between the keayboard I have been using for almost 2 years and the new one is the thickness. The nuphy is low-profile and doesn't need a wrist rest on a desk. On the other hand, the one I am using now is a typical mechanical keayboard, which uses chnky switches and has a longer travel distance when pressing a key. I wanted a keayboad that I coudl easily carry with my laptop and place over the laptop's keayboard to type and utse the shortcuts or key bindings I prefer. I haven't received the parcel yet, but I am really looking forawrd to using it, as I have evenr written about this keayboard in my diary twice.

* I watched a youtube video that a man tried to switch to a US layout keayboard from JIS layout. He pointed out one of the stambling points is the Kana/Eng switch key that is placed next to space key in JIS layout. Most of JIS users have a habit to switch JP/En mode by pressing the EN/KANA button, which might be a biggest struggle or frustlation for JIS users. However, he said the key bind control + space was fine for him and he has already been used to the key bind. The other difference between US and JIS is the size of enter key. Enter key in JIS layout is vertically long, however, the enter in US layout is one-key hight. Some people have a habit to type down enter key from backspace button when removing letters and pressing enter, which might cause a mis-input for the pople.

* I went to the post office this afternoon, and I finnaly have got a Nuphy air75 v2 which I ordered last Saturday. This is the keyboard I was looking forward to replacing Maja v2 chunky and heavy one I used for almost 2 years. The feeling of Nuphy is not so bad despite its thin body. I can feel the decent lubed mechanical switches and its sound. I am pretty satisfied this keyboard although I struggled to configure layouts using via as it needed firmware updateing using QMK tools to compatible the latest via json file. There is a web page explains how to connect to via using json file, but only a reddit post mentioned the firmware update is needed. Also, QMK tool didn't work on my windows laptop as it required admin rights to recognize and overwrite the firmware. I ended up installing the qmk tool on my mac and finnaly I was able to connect via. It was long way to make my Nuphy mykey bind, I am now happy to type with this keyboard.

* THe next thing in my bucket list especially to buy something is an amp simulator. I had a several effectors and amps to practice guitars, none of them made me keep me playing the guitar. My goal of guitar playing is just having a habit to keep practice and hopefully I would be able to play the guitar as ideal state as I imagine. So my priorities when it comes to choosing the guitar rigs are an easiness to plug and play and quality of the sound. As it is a tool to practice the guitar, it must be easy to operate core functionalities, which are tuners, rithm machine, and the sound selection. Plus, it is important for me to feel a good sound and motivate me play the guitar more. In conclusion, selecting a proper quality of product is crutial for the pople who wants to enjoy and keep the hobby life-long time, and buying on price will lose your opportunities and your money.
* The next item on my bucket list, particularly in terms of purchases, is an amp simulator. Despite having tried several effectors and amps for practicing guitar, none of them have succeeded in keeping me engaged. My goal in playing the guitar is simply to establish a consistent practice routine, with the hope of eventually reaching the level of proficiency I envision. Therefore, my primary considerations when selecting guitar equipment are ease of use and sound quality. Since it's a tool for honing my guitar skills, it needs to offer straightforward operation for essential functions such as tuning, rhythm generation, and sound selection. Additionally, it's crucial for me to experience a satisfying sound that inspires me to play more. In conclusion, choosing a high-quality product is essential for those who aim to derive lasting enjoyment from their hobby. Opting for cheaper alternatives risks missing out on opportunities and wasting money.

* I tried some AI assistent tools that help people learn a language, but I hardly come across the one that is affordable and feels good to talk. Whenever I try AI speak apps or kind of AI sparker, I feel like I am being recorded and evalated by someone, it makes me a bit awkward to talk myself hounestly. Plus, talking to myself too much details could lead a unhappy consequences if data breach happens. It is quite common to practice to talk yourself in most of English exams, like the country and town you live in, the type of accomodation, the subject you mejar in uni. Those personal infomation seems to be sabtle, but if some pople who can associate those information to other your personal informaiton, it may leads critical problem. So AI speak apps are absolutely strong tools to enhance your ability to practice your language skill, however, you need to be aware that unlike human, all things you talk may be recorded and talking too detailed information may result unwanted data breach and hacking risks.

Whenever I try AI speaking apps or similar tools, I feel like I am being recorded and evaluated by someone, which makes me feel a bit awkward. Additionally, talking to myself in too much detail could lead to unhappy consequences if a data breach occurs. It is quite common to practice speaking about personal topics in most English exams, such as the country and town you live in, the type of accommodation you have, or the subject you major in at university. These pieces of personal information might seem subtle, but if someone can connect them to other personal information, it could lead to critical problems. AI speaking apps are definitely powerful tools to enhance your language skills. However, it is important to be aware that, unlike human interactions, everything you say may be recorded. Sharing too much detailed information may result in unwanted data breaches and hacking risks.

* Today My son and I went to the zoo where we have an anual membership. The main attractions of the zoo is the touching zone where people can touch some animals like Kangaroos and donkeies etc. My son really likes the touching animals zone and he kept screaming and chasing animals. I felt it was a bit annoying and a shame for animals to be chaised, but it was really nice experience for my son to see and touch the real animals rather than seeing them in a pictture dictionary or videos. Seeing by himself eyes and touching himself are quite important to understand the world, and I think that will be a night and day differences in the long run.

* expressing and describinh the thing under your nose is significantly important. You ability of speaking and writng depends on your cognition and relations of vocabraries in your mind and netwok. Without any relation or hint your brain cna't use the vocaburary. I think those are called in-active vocaburary or passive vocaburary. You can understand the meaning when you encounter the word and expression, but you can't come up with the word when you speak and write. It is saied that increasing active vocaburary is in your mind is the key to acquire fuluency and wide range of expressions. I need to brush up the skill and that is why I am writing my thoughts here.\
* Expressing and describing the things right in front of you is significantly important. Your ability to speak and write depends on your cognition and the relationships between vocabularies in your mind and network. Without any relation or hint, your brain can’t use the vocabulary. I believe these are called inactive or passive vocabulary. You can understand the meaning when you encounter the word or expression, but you can’t come up with the word when you speak or write. It is said that increasing active vocabulary is the key to acquiring fluency and a wide range of expressions. I need to brush up on this skill, and that is why I am writing my thoughts here.

* I noticed that I am not an extravert personalty. The reason is I am feeling exhausted after we go over a friend house to have a party today. I heard that extravert people feel happy and refreshing and intravert people feel exhausting when hanging out with friends or attendting a home party. However, I don't like any ideas that dividing people binary though it is easy to imagine and explain the typical situation. I am sure all people have some portion of both extravert and intravert personality. People may feel they are extravert personality if they feel a bit of out of conversation during the party, but it is an excuse or giving up improving your ability by thinking that you are like the personality and the things could not be changed with your effort. You need to be aware of the reality of your ability and face toward the problems to figure out how to brush up the weak point of you. So I am intravert and Extravert personality in the end.

People may feel they are introverted if they feel a bit out of the conversation during a party, but thinking of it as an excuse or giving up on improving your abilities is not helpful. You need to be aware of your abilities and face your challenges to figure out how to improve your weak points. So, in the end, I am both introverted and extroverted.

* I completed reading Atomic Habits yessterday night. It was very good book for me to understand how to keep good habits and how to distruct bad habits. The book said there are four rules to keep a good habit; Make it obvious, make it easy, make it attractive, make it satisfying. I felt some of them are what exactlly I have been doing to keep and improve my skills. Wrting my effort on a markdown and commit to github is a way to keep track my study, but it also helps make it satisfying the logging by filling the github calender in green Acutually, I somehow felt pleasant by seeing the streak of green calender, and I felt the sympathy and completely agree with the idea that logging makes your study habit enjoyable and satisfyable. Probably, the most important takeaways from this book is you should't set too high goal, but achievable and lower goal and boring is the biggest stumbling block when it comes to continuing habits in the long period, and that makes the difference between the people who can master something or just scratch the surface. I need to keep good habits.

* Reading books is one of my pleasant time before go to bed, actually I read books on bed before get sleep. I have been continued this habit since 2022 when I visited Japan for the first time. The first book I really got into was Harry Potter. I coudn't stop reding it by imagining the fantastic magical world and how Harry ended up to go Hogwarts. It took almost a half year to read all the series of Harry potter, but I think those experieces give me some confident or unfear to read books or long texts in english. This morning I watched a youtube video that told how to read books fast. The point the youtuber said was that you shoudn't read a loud texts in your brain. I came into the same tips from other japanese web sites. I believe it is true and a good tip for the people who are already familier with the language a lot or mother language, however, for the people who use it as second language it is significantly further step to read book without read a loud. My brain is hard coded to read a loud in my brain, actually I feel like listening voice even when I write this dairy. I am not fluent enough to do this tip...

However, for those who use it as a second language, reading without subvocalizing is a significantly more advanced step. My brain is hardwired to read aloud in my mind; in fact, I feel like I am listening to a voice even as I write this diary. I am not fluent enough to use this tip yet...

* Aftter started to write diary everyday, I feel I am now able to speak more fuluently than before. Especially, I became I can speak about my feelings and opinions without hesitation. Of course sometimes I fail to make the point straght and construct sentenses without any mistakes, I would say I am not like butterfilies in my stomach or pulling the trigger to say trivial things. I think this is thanks to the habits of writing anything everyday and learning vocaburaries with some books. I need to maintain these habits not to get boring.
* After starting to write a diary every day, I feel I am now able to speak more fluently than before. Especially, I can now express my feelings and opinions without hesitation. Of course, sometimes I fail to make my point clearly and construct sentences without any mistakes, but I would say I no longer have butterflies in my stomach or feel like I'm pulling the trigger to say trivial things. I think this improvement is thanks to the habit of writing every day and learning new vocabulary from some books. I need to maintain these habits to keep from getting bored.

* when it comes to traveling, sometimes I don't have time to plan the activity and places beforehand, but somehow I feel it is more enjoyable not to preparing the plan than when preparing a lot. It might be due to the fact that your plan wouldn't go as planned always, because of a lot of undecided factors like weather conditions, your and your family mental and phsical condiotns, and estimation of time. It is impossible to make a perfect plan and execute them without any differences, and the more dense your plan becomes, the mroe gap and stress you will experience. I think this is the reason why you feel going to travel on the fly is more enjoyable.
* laces beforehand. However, I find it more enjoyable to travel without a detailed plan. This might be because plans often don't go as expected due to various unpredictable factors like weather conditions, the mental and physical states of you and your family, and time estimations. It's impossible to create and execute a perfect plan without any deviations. The more detailed your plan is, the more gaps and stress you might experience. This is why I believe traveling spontaneously is more enjoyable.

* I've been to a popular sightseeing spot today. It was spectaclar scenery that tremendaous green forests speading until horizon line and iconic hill standing majestically. I didin't know that, but I have heard that it is a world heiritage site. It was pretty easy access from the center of the city by driving and even the train is also available to go there. I thought this place is the must-go place when you visit this country.

* This time I took three days off for visiting other place in this country to praise myself for keeping good habits. I feel like refreshed completely by seeing great nature scenery that I had never imagined and nice authentic chinese foods. When I travel I dodn't usually expect foods in locals, but the food in the state was amazing, especially chinese food. I heard lots of chinese people migrated in the area and it makes sense that there are lots of authentic chinese restaurant in there. Especially I really liked the dumplings and noodles that I heard they are from northen part of china. Noodles was different to Japanese ramen in terms of the base of bross soup and noodles themselves. The chinese noodles is more like smooth and soft as if Udon in Japan. either way, I really impressed the chinese food in the state even though it is not in china.
* This time, I took three days off to visit another part of the country as a reward for maintaining good habits. I felt completely refreshed by the breathtaking natural scenery I had never imagined and the delicious, authentic Chinese food. When I travel, I usually don't have high expectations for local cuisine, but the food in this region was amazing, especially the Chinese food. I heard that many Chinese people have migrated to the area, which explains the abundance of authentic Chinese restaurants. I particularly enjoyed the dumplings and noodles, which I learned are from the northern part of China. The noodles were different from Japanese ramen, both in the broth base and the noodles themselves. The Chinese noodles were smooth and soft, similar to Udon in Japan. Overall, I was very impressed with the Chinese food in the area, even though it's not in China.

* I think stress in work could affects the private life. Especially if you find something like you thought it was true but it was mistake, you would feel like you were put on the courner. However, most of work could be wrong and even nobody notice it is wrong. I think you are lucky to find your mistakes and can ake the experience better understanding of the thing and behind the scene more. I believe this can help you be more professional and experienced.
* I think stress at work can affect your personal life. Especially if you discover something you believed to be true was actually a mistake, it can make you feel cornered. However, many mistakes at work go unnoticed. I believe you're lucky to find your mistakes because it gives you a chance to learn and gain a deeper understanding of the situation. This can help you become more professional and experienced.

* Writing your feelings and opinions is a good habit and strategy to keep your mind clear. It is my experience when I was a grad and started working in a company, but I was not able to organize my ideas well even in my mother tongue and felt a lot of stress and pressure that most of them were out of my control or difficult to address. If your concerning thing is related to lack of your skill and have enough time to address it, it is a chance to brush up your possibility to grow. However, there are so many things that you are out of your reach and even you are not supposed to see it, Ingnoring is bliss. So what I learnt from my experience is; Writing the things you concerns into just a bullet points and sorting out each point whether those are in your responsibility or out of your control or things you want to do. the tip make you feel better.
* Writing down your feelings and opinions is a good habit and an effective strategy to keep your mind clear. When I was a graduate and started working at a company, I struggled to organize my ideas, even in my native language. This caused me a lot of stress and pressure, much of which was beyond my control or difficult to address. If your concerns are related to a lack of skills and you have enough time to address them, it's an opportunity to grow. However, many things are beyond your control and not your responsibility. In such cases, ignoring them can be a blessing. From my experience, I learned that writing down your concerns as bullet points and sorting each point into categories—whether they are within your responsibility, out of your control, or things you want to do—can make you feel better.

* Even though it past several month since I bought a BBQ grill, I still need practicing to grill a steak. I think I did typical and gold standard preparation for steak today, like putting a frozen steak meat a day before we eat, seasoning with generous amount of sult and pappers and grilling with lid for about 4mins each side and resting in foils about 3mins. Despite the way to cook, the state of the steak was not the one I expected. I expected midium-rare, but it was almost a rare. I don't know which step was wrong today, but the biggest mistake I did today was I didn't use theormometer to guage the temprature of the center of the meat. Quantifying the quality of baking is crucial process when it comes to making a good meal.
* Even though several months have passed since I bought a BBQ grill, I still need practice grilling steak. Today, I thought I followed the typical and gold standard preparation for steak: thawing a frozen steak a day before cooking, generously seasoning with salt and pepper, grilling with the lid on for about 4 minutes on each side, and resting it in foil for about 3 minutes. Despite following these steps, the steak didn't turn out as expected. I was aiming for medium-rare, but it ended up almost rare. I'm not sure which step went wrong today, but the biggest mistake was not using a thermometer to gauge the temperature at the center of the meat. Accurately measuring the doneness is crucial when aiming to prepare a good meal.

 * I am writing this on a bed today. I usually write a diary on a desk in another bedroom, but I felt like I wanted to change the taste today. It may help me feel fresh and keep the habit to write my opinion on my own words to brush up English and language ability itself. I believe there are some people who can improve their language skill through just talking to people, but I am not like the person. I need to consider carefully the word and what I am going to say and write a bit of time, and that pause is usually too long when talking to people. I don't know this is on the right track when acquiring fluency, but writing gives me plenty time to organize the idea what I am feeling and choose the correct and closest word that can express what I am thinking. So it is awkward for the people who has just started to write a diary recently, but it will change you little by little. 
 * I am writing this in bed today. I usually write my diary at a desk in another bedroom, but I felt like changing things up today. This change may help me feel refreshed and maintain the habit of writing my thoughts in my own words to improve my English and overall language skills. I believe some people can improve their language skills just by talking to others, but I am not one of those people. I need to carefully consider the words I use and what I want to say, and that pause is usually too long when speaking to others. I don't know if this is the right approach to acquiring fluency, but writing gives me plenty of time to organize my thoughts and choose the correct and closest words to express what I am thinking. It might feel awkward for people who have just started keeping a diary, but it will change you little by little.

 * I have been flustrated this monitor I have used since I got it from the company for working from home. The reason is that the setting of the monitor moves without touching. Crossing mark or maginifying area for FPS games shows every 10 mins and it drives me nuts. I need to talk to the person who is in IT department to replace this monitor to new one. Otherwise, I might destroy the monitor with furry someday.
 * I have been frustrated with this monitor since I got it from the company for working from home. The problem is that the settings on the monitor change without me touching it. A crosshair or magnifying area for FPS games appears every 10 minutes, and it drives me nuts. I need to talk to someone in the IT department to replace this monitor with a new one. Otherwise, I might destroy it in a fit of rage someday.

 * I am getting used to write a diary at end of day, but I am also getting feel bored to it. For the first week, I had completely no ideas to write and what to start. However, I can now express my opinion more clearly and quicker. Also, the habit made me a bit confident even at work. I used to use chatgpt or so on almost my reply to chat, and took very long time to review a reply and revise with AI. However, now I can reply immediately and I feel Telling and considering what you are thinking and feeling is much more important than revising the grammer or words of it. People want you to give them your opinion, not a nice wrote english sentenses but no content. Your opinion or content is 100 times worth. Therefore, I will maintain this writing habit mainly focusing on output and substance my feelings and thinking into written something.

 * I am on two minds whether to buy a Xreal Air 2 pro, which is AR glassess manily focused on providing immersed monitor. Unlike other AR/VR glasses such as Apple vision pro, it doesn't have fancy functionality like recognizing your fingers and using the motions to contole the divice. However, the Xreal device focused on providing the virtual monitor environment, which would be the most useful thing for 99% people when it comes to utilizing AR/VR. Of-course they can enhance its virtual reality by combining fancy technologies that Meta and Apple are doing, but I think such functionalities are just being showed off by those companies, and won't give us really useful tool that we use everyday work/studying. Xreal is cut down such nice-to-have and bells and whistles of AR/VR grasses and give us just "needed" tool, that is why I would like to get my hands on it and try.
 * I am torn between whether to buy the Xreal Air 2 Pro, AR glasses primarily focused on providing an immersive monitor experience. Unlike other AR/VR glasses like Apple's Vision Pro, it lacks advanced functionalities such as finger recognition and motion control. However, the Xreal device prioritizes creating a virtual monitor environment, which is likely the most practical feature for 99% of users interested in AR/VR. While companies like Meta and Apple enhance their products with flashy technologies, I believe such features are more about showcasing than providing genuinely useful tools for everyday work or studying. Xreal strips away these extras from AR/VR glasses and offers a focused, essential tool. That's why I'm eager to try it out.

 * Using chatGPT to practice writing english is really convenient for me. Unlike human based service like online english service, you don't have to spare chunk of time like 30min, and you can do whenever you want. What you have to do is just asking ChatGPTS to have a chat with you with a specific topic you want to talk. I have never tried yet, but the latest model can do a kind of near realtime conversation, and it enable you practice talking as if you talk to somebody. I think this is one of the most correct way to use AI. I hope many people stop using AI in a wrong way, but use the splendid technology more good way to enhance human ability.

 * I have been getting weight since I started pumping irons because I need a lot of proteins and carbo to get mascle. However, it seems like getting mascle without getting any fat is impossible according to some youtube videos I watched. It means I need to lose my fat at some point, otherwise I am going to be a fat man with lots of mascles. I need find a way to lose fat as small loss mascle as possible. One thing I have seen was walking everymorning before brakfast. It said that doing a modarate excercising in the starving condition makes your body use and burn your fat as energy and eventually lose your weight. it makes sense. I need to start walking everymorning, but I am just a too lazy not to be able to get up early in the morning. I need to work on that...
 * gain weight

 * as little mascle loss as possible

 * My means of commute depends on days. On Monday, I drive my car and drop my kids off at childcare and park at the office. On Tuesday and Wednesday, I don't ususlly use the car, but I take ferry. Taking a bus is the fastest way to get to the office, but I like feeling breeze on ferry and relax on the seat. THe ferry is also less packed compared to other public transport, so I can be productive on a ferry, like considering the texts of email, writing documents, watching a youtube video, and so on and forth. On Thursday, I drive the car the same as on Monday. I really hate driving in rush hours. It takes almost an hour to get to my place as it takes only 15mins in non rush hours. Nothing boring and non-productive time than driving in traffic. That is why I use public transportation and pay fees on Tuesday and Wednesday rather than driving in traffic and taking risks for accidents. On Friday, it's half and half to go to the office by car or work from home. it's up to my mood and family situation.

* I have been practicing blues guitar because the blues music is cool, it's also cool to improvise music and it is calm compared to other music genre for youth like metal, punk, phyche and so on. I tried Jazz music several years ago, but I ended up holding up learning it then, as I don't listen to Jazz so often and its scales of notes were too complicated. Holding up learning jazz doesn't mean I gave up, but just suspended for now and I am keen to learn Jazz in the future. Blues is basically more simple when it comes to the scales, Blues uses mainly minor and major pentatonic scales with blue note. That's very simple, but there are lots of songs created by the simple scale over past 70years. I think most people don't like the complexity and tend to like music simple enough that can sing the melody with voice. I think that's the reason blues is loved by many people for long time.
* I've been practicing blues guitar because I find blues music cool. It's enjoyable to improvise and it has a calming vibe compared to other genres popular among youth, like metal, punk, and psychedelic music. A few years ago, I tried getting into jazz, but I ended up pausing my learning journey because I don't listen to jazz frequently and its scales are quite complex. Pausing my jazz studies doesn't mean I've given up on it; I plan to revisit learning jazz in the future. Blues music is simpler in terms of scales. It mainly uses minor and major pentatonic scales along with the blues note. Despite its simplicity, blues has produced countless songs over the past 70 years. I believe many people prefer music that is simpler and allows them to sing along with the melody. This simplicity may explain why blues has been loved by so many people for such a long time."

* I bought a Spark Go, which is a new guitar gear for me. The reason I bought this is becasuse the headphone amp I was using to practice guitar has been making noise when I connect it to the guitar. I thought the headphone amp has broken, but the truth was different. When I connected the new arrived amp with the guitar, it didn't make any sound. The guitar has been something wrong and causing noise when connected to the headphone amp. It is a typical mistake of troubleshooting. You didn't see right under your nose and consider the other possbilities. So the next thing I need to do to enjoy my guitar life is, maybe buying a new guitar or fix the guitar somehow.

* I wonder how people come across and learn new vocaburaly. I have been using dictionary book that shows selected words and expressions and published in Japan. I think it is effective and efficient to use these dictionary type book when learning vocaburary becasuse you can learn useful and frequently used expressions without spending a lot of time to read books and watch movies. However, I think learning vocaburary from literatures and master pieces of movies might be more beneficial in the long run, cause you can easily continue the habit to touch the language without feeling efforts and studying. Having said that, I still want to learn commonly used expressions throught the series of dictionary book I have been laerning as the words and idioms I see in the books are really used in daily and business conversations.

* I have been under the weather since Sunday. I think I've got something Covid or Flu from my child. Wondering if there is a data or study that the people who have children are more high rate of infection than the people who don't have any children or partner. I think the thoery that people who have children are more suseptable for infection makes sense for me because they share the same air very long hours and close like when sleeping in the same bed.

* Time Machine is the book I have been reading since I caught a cold. I have read just half of it, but the story was already something different to the general time travel ones. The typical time travel story is related to time paradox, re-do something, multi verse and so on, but the interesting viewpoint of this book is focusing on the future state of human being. How our human kind will evolve is the topic of the book. I can't wait to read the rest of the book.

* Keeping a studying habit in busy state is hard. I tend to skip my habits when I am busy for work bacause I feel like my brain is occupied with it and fully used to sort out the issue I am having. I think this state makes my field of view narrower and may choose short solving choice rather than the solution that could be a good in the long run. I am curious how it happens from phycological perspective, but anyway, I think doing and keeping your hobbies even in busy situation makes you keep your head cool and lead a correct dicisions.

* I am wondering what am I supposed to write. If the topic is too specific for myself and my living, the journal could be very dangerous for me and family because someone might be able to identifying me using the information. I don't mind to be honest disclosing my private as long as it is not too far though. I recommend someone who might watching here that should not take all the thing as gospel as I actually write this diary with some untrue or making up information sometimes. Houwever, the recent chatGPT or kind of generative AI may be able to distinguish my concealment and idenfify some private information even some password or critical and credential information. I need to be careful, but I don't think there is a person who can spend his or her precious time to watch here and put some effort for me. I am just leaving my diary here just to improve my writing skill and sort out my ideas. there is no worth in literatures or reading this.

* I have been to a Korean BBQ restaurant for the first time in this city. WHen I lived in the previous city, there were lots of Korean restaurants and most of them are very affordable compared to other Izakaya style restaurants and tastes very nice. However, the Korean restraunts here is more like a fancy type of food and costs almost more than double than I eat in the past place. It was good that the taste was very nice and I felt nostalgiic though.
* I recently visited a Korean BBQ restaurant for the first time in this city. In my previous city, there were many Korean restaurants, most of which were very affordable compared to other Izakaya-style restaurants and tasted great.

* I wonder why my friend cannot stick to study and achieve a certain level. I admit I am a bit easy to get bored when I reach improvement in a cetain extent. but it seems there are people who can't be reach at that level and nothing achieved.

* introducing myself is a kind of thing that I need to work on more. I always wing it and fail. The little preparation make me feel that self-introduction is difficult. So going forward, I think one strategy to overcome the feeling of weakness is preparing what you say like a template for such a situation meeting people first time. However, I think experiencing and meeting as many people as possible is the fastest way to get used to introducting yourself.

* It is always good to prepare and imagine the things that if you have never experienced that. I felt this today when I drove to the airport with high up people. I don't usually use a toll road, but I needed to use it to get to the airport as soon as possible due to their flight schedule. On my way to pick up them from airport, I took the way as practice, and it turned out that the route was not easy and there were lots of place I need to change the lanes. I ended up driving without any problems, but I might have different result if I haven't prepared and practiced it. Of-course too much of preparation might be a backfire sometimes, but I think it is good to think and image what it is going to be just in case.

* why do people usually say you should be kind to older people? I think they are already out of the way and young people don't have to put lots of efforts to them.

* I have re-started pumping iron since I got a cold last week. I think I am fully recovered and I did dead-lift today.

* We have visited a zoo yesterday. It was kind of a complex place of a zoo and an natural asretchinc facilities. There were lots of animals including some iconic ones in this country and we wanted to take photos there. Unfortunately, the photo taking time was already passed when we got to the place, we ended up getting a free voucher for the next time.

* Recently, I have been trying a call whenever I have a chance in daily life. Today I had two calls, one was to the gym I have been going for almost a year. I wanted to ask them to reissue a gym fob key that I have lost one somewhere on Sunday. The second chance was to ask car servicing center to replace the battery of my car. Whenever I call, I write down the points for the conversation because I am afraid of getting confusing what I want to say. Even my mother tongue, calling is a difficult and a bit of awkward task because you don't want to experience any awkward moment and mis-communications. Although people who get my call might be fiddly to respond as I ask saying again and again sometimes, I think it is the work the people have to do in this country, and good for me to practice real conversation that I cannot do in Japane definitely.

I wanted to ask them to reissue a gym fob key that I lost somewhere on Sunday. The second call was to a car servicing center to replace my car's battery. Whenever I call, I write down the key points of the conversation because I am afraid of getting confused about what I want to say. Even in my mother tongue, making calls is a difficult and somewhat awkward task because you want to avoid any awkward moments or miscommunications. Although the people I call might find it a bit tedious to repeat themselves sometimes, I think it’s part of their job, and it’s good for me to practice real conversations that I definitely cannot do in Japan.

* I saw a youtube video that mentioned listening and reading are essentially the same thing. It was suprising for me that I thought listening is more high level skill than reading. Because you can change speeds and look back when reading, while listening is required to understand the meanings only once and fixed speed. However, it sounded like both ability use the same part of brain as long as the difficulty of meanings are the same. So I think it means that listening and audio books are quite efficient and useful when you cannot look at books like while you are walking, or on tread mill.
* I saw a YouTube video that mentioned listening and reading are essentially the same thing. It was surprising to me because I thought listening was a higher-level skill than reading. With reading, you can change speeds and look back, while with listening, you need to understand the meanings in real-time and at a fixed speed. However, the video explained that both abilities use the same part of the brain, as long as the difficulty of the material is the same. So, I think this means that listening to audiobooks is quite efficient and useful, especially when you cannot look at books, such as while walking or on a treadmill.

* I stil feel that speaking in front of people is difficult and I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach. The reason of this is because I am simply not good at constructing sentences and choosing words correctly regardress in English or Japanese. Another reason is that sometimes I don't understand or I don't concentrate on the things takled. This might be because of fatigue or lack of sleep. It is impossible to concentrate on the everything I see and hear in daily life, however, I need to judge scenes that I have to focus on or not. I think that is something to do with so called Productivity.
* I still feel that speaking in front of people is difficult, and I often get butterflies in my stomach. The reason is that I am simply not good at constructing sentences and choosing words correctly, whether in English or Japanese. Another reason is that sometimes I don't understand or don't concentrate on what is being talked about. This might be due to fatigue or lack of sleep. It is impossible to concentrate on everything I see and hear in daily life, but I need to judge which scenes I have to focus on. I think this has something to do with what is called productivity.

* What I really hate my friend is that they alwasy complains around her and doesn't move on a positive side to change it by themselves. I don't think that is a constructive or progressive way to deal with the challenges you face. You need to face the issue and think how you can feel better by figuring out the problems. Your brain is not just to feel sad. What are you thinking and doing? I understand that you can't controll everything and you shouldn't think so, however, there must be someway to solve or avert it. What you have to do is just thinking.

* It was almost a week since I started walking in the morning. I began walking because I wanted to lose fat on my belly and prepare for playing baseball planned in October. I have been gained almost 10kg since last year and I believe half of them are muscles. I watched some youtube videos mentioned walking in the morening before breakfast makes your fat burn efficiently.

* Spark 2 has been rolled out from positive grid few days ago. I didn't have any ideas what it does mean because there are several spark amp models and what model they are talking about. However, it turned out it was about a 40W size amp. It sounded like the biggest change from the previous models is the buit-in looper and drum machine functionalities. Another is having the portability with a special optional battery, which allow to bring your amp to anywhere without static power and play on the street, in a camp site, and so on. I think havbing a built-on drum machine or looper is really useful to practice the guitar alone. I tend to use a looper and rithm machine to practice improvising and small jam, but I need to launch some app and operate the app, and it makes a bit annoying me. Thus, I think the quicker you can start rithms, the more self-motivated and enjoyable you play the guitar.

* I am thinking to buy a smart weight scale that can send the records to a common app of the same brand as the smartwatch I am using. The good thing is that I don't have to open a different app to review my weight and weight is strongly relevant to excercise and the smartwatch is able to log your exciercise and it's best place to review your information of exciercising and weight trend.

* I am sleepy. I gotta go to bed early, but I have to finish my journaling habit before. I started this maybe a month ago, but I relly like this because writing your ideas or thinking somewhere helps you sort out the issues you have and points you have to work on. It takes a little bit time to get used to writing from nowhere, but I am now feeling good and want to continue this.

* I have no idea what to do to imporove my speaking skill in English. I know vocabulary is the all and end of it, and it is important to expose myself touching English countents as much time as possible. As a foreigner living in English speaking country, I already got used to listening and reading contents in English, but I think I have been just numbing or on autopilot without deeply understanding them. People especially adults can easily adopts a new environment using their experiences, but I think children are more suceptible to the change of environment. That is why I think children are more absorbent when it comes to learning a language spoken around them. I believe that writing a journal like this will help imporove my skills in the long run.

* I am gonna talk about the cultural differences between Japan and this country. It is obviouis and easy to say that language, people, culture, and climite are different, but imporatnt thing is how I felt and affectc when it comes to living. Because the environment differences affects your personality, and how you feel is varies depending on the things and people around you. Ok, let's get the ball rolling, the first thing I want to mention is the difference in professionalism. In japan, professional people is like the person is like modest, low-key and very calm, however, in this country, the person who is popular and good reputation is all communicatable and convincible. So communication skill is the start and end of it. Of copuse the knowledge and insightful thinking is also contributing the abvility of communication, but I think behave and talk like professional is one of the skill to make client confortable and want to buy products and sevices from the person.

* You need to put the hard yard when it comes to keeping a study habit. Actually, this journaling is one of study habit for me to work on my english speaking skill, but sometimes I feel fiddly to consider and write. However, I think this is the only habit that I can express and output the things I am anxious or want to express. I believe this is good way to sort out my ideas and want to continue.
*  I find it difficult

* I am fed up with my friend attitude not to learn anything around him. He basically doens't know knowledges and skills are created by a tiny study habit that is different to the way to study when we were students. You are the only one who needs to find time and how you use the precious time to study. You can't have enoght chunk of time to sit down in the desk, while you have to use up your time like listening audio book while you are washing the dishes. There must be some time you can spare to study, and what you have to do is throwing away smartphones and watching cheap youtube videos, and just start something very easy things but related to study. You will be able to accumulate small effort, but it is going to be a huge pile of skills and experiences for you.

* Listening is more efficient way to remember vocaburary rather than just reading. I think it is because our brain is more sensitive of sound of words genetically due to the long history of human language. Some people argued that people have been speaking since they became a "human" for over millions years ago(maybe I don't know when the first human emerged), but the letters and wrting systems invented quite a recent years(maybe within 3000 years?). So our brain and the part of it related to communication shoudl be designed to listen and make sounds, not for writing and reading. Thus, I believe listening sound and getting exporse yourself into the contents listening is good way to learn vocaburary.

* This morning, I ended up going to the gym without my smartphone because I forgot to set it on the charger last night. I usually browsing news and watch youtube videos while walking on the treadmil for about 25mins, but I didn't have the tool to enjoy contents this morning. I though I may have bring my laptop to listen to music or radio, but I didn't do that because it obviously looked silly. So I ended up talking myself without making any sound, and it was really good for me to practice speaking. The first several minutes are a bit awkward to speak by myself wondering what to say and to choose correct words, but I found myself can speak comparatebely smooth and fluent. I experienced the same feeling when I had nothing to do in the U.S. and suffered to sleep due to jet lag. So talking myself might be a worth a shot if I feel I am stambling choosing words and expressions.

* Today I had an internal learning session meeting organizing myself to teach how to use new system to some team members. I felt I could deliver at least some basics of them, though I feel I went a bit off the topic sometimes. It is quite difficult to teach stuff people, but I think the most important thing is enjoying talking to what you want to tell. Without enjoying the presentation, you will not be able to deliver the value and essense efficiently since the lister feel your nerves feelings and take your saying with a grain of salt. You have to enjoy talking when it comes to speaking and presenting in front of people.

* My colleague said that he has been offered a job from one of our customer, but he said he will turn down it due to the location of the office. I think it is not a suprising thing in this country to offer a job among relationships, but it made me thinking on the future a bit. I would like to keep this kind of job in the long haul and have some experiences, but I need to organize a lot of things in Japan before I really start working this country like pensions, stocks, bank accounts, and visa. I believe I am a bit lack of points when it comes to applying permanent resident visa, so I need some time to get it. Either way, learning english is the first and all of the future of my life. I will work on and hard on it.
* My colleague mentioned that he was offered a job by one of our clients, but he said he would turn it down due to the office location. I don’t think it’s surprising in this country for job offers to come through personal connections, but it did make me think about the future. I’d like to stay in this type of job for the long term and gain more experience, but I need to take care of a lot of things in Japan before I can fully commit to working here, such as pensions, stocks, bank accounts, and my visa. I believe I might be lacking in some areas when it comes to applying for a permanent resident visa, so I’ll need some time to prepare for that. In any case, learning English is my top priority, and it will shape the future of my life. I’m committed to working hard on it.

* Having a good funiture makes life good. I like go to Ikea and seek to find oppotunity of home improvemnet. I went to Nitori or Muji quite often when I was in Japan, but now Ikea is my go-to place to find something new. The interesting thing of Ikea is that they intorduce funiture every season like clothes, and some people at least me are looking forward to seeing what the new items are and whether a new funiture could fit my room or not. I like this considering process although I know this is a kind of brain reaction that produce dopamin when it comes to buying something.
* Having good furniture makes life better. I enjoy going to Ikea and looking for opportunities to improve my home. When I was in Japan, I often visited Nitori or Muji, but now Ikea is my go-to place for discovering something new. What's interesting about Ikea is that they introduce new furniture every season, much like fashion brands do with clothes. Some people, including myself, look forward to seeing the latest items and considering whether a new piece of furniture would fit well in our homes. I enjoy this process of deliberation, even though I know it triggers a dopamine response in the brain, which is associated with the excitement of buying something

* I noticed that my speaking skill become rusty during weekends as I don't speak so much. I felt I need to work on practicing speaking sometimes not only writing journal here.

Speaking of raining, my unbrella is not large enough to cover my body and backpack. When I use the umbrealla, my backpack is always wet since it can't be covered by the umbrealla. I wanna get a large one, but it doesn't rain a lot in this counry, so I always drop the memory to buy it even I went to shopping mall or somewhere I can buy. actually it is fine for me because I don't have to spend to the iteams that I don't use so much.

I want to get a larger one, but it doesn't rain much in this country, so I always forget to buy it even when I'm at the mall or somewhere I could pick one up.

* I have been using this low-profile keyboard for several months. For the first or second week, I was really satisfied its thinner height compared to usual full keyboards with full-size MX switches, but I gradually noticed some drawbacks of this keyboard; bluetooth inteference with headsets and flat key caps. The first issue of bluetooth intererence is I guess only this product and other low-profile keyboards may not be the same. Second one is that the key top is too flat that it cause a lot of mistypes. I prefer more like scruptured type of key tops. So I am thinking to back to a normal height mechanical keyboard with confortable scruptured key caps. Too much simplification spoils functionality. Considering balances between functionality and easy-to-use is the key to be a good product customer choose.
* I've been using this low-profile keyboard for several months. In the first couple of weeks, I was really satisfied with its thinner profile compared to standard keyboards with full-size MX switches. However, I gradually noticed some drawbacks. One issue is Bluetooth interference with my headset, which might be specific to this product or possibly other low-profile keyboards as well. The second issue is that the keycaps are too flat, leading to frequent mistypes. I prefer more sculpted keycaps for better accuracy. As a result, I'm considering switching back to a regular-height mechanical keyboard with comfortable, sculpted keycaps. Over-simplification can compromise functionality, so finding the right balance between functionality and ease of use is crucial for creating a product that customers will choose.

* I'm gonna talk about my Daily Routine. My day start around 6AM and the first thing I do every morning is go to the gym where is just a minutes from my place and walkking for 25mins. I started this habit a month ago to lose my belly fat, but at the same time it helps me study english, meditation, organize ideas etc. After waking, I go home, take a shower, and make breakfast for two; my child and me. I usually eat chicken or salmon, one or two eggs, and rice. After eating breakfast, I start making coffee that I drink during commuting. Around 7:45 I am off to work. It depends on the tasks I work on, but usually I get home around 6PM and have dinner with family. Spending several hours with family by taking a bath and studying, I go to bed around 10PM. That is pretty much of my day.

I started this habit a month ago to lose belly fat, but at the same time, it helps me study English, meditate, organize my ideas, etc. After walking, I go home, take a shower, and make breakfast for two—my child and me. I usually eat chicken or salmon, one or two eggs, and rice. After breakfast, I make coffee, which I drink during my commute. Around 7:45 AM, I head off to work. It depends on the tasks I have, but I usually get home around 6 PM and have dinner with my family. After spending several hours with my family, including taking a bath and studying, I go to bed around 10 PM. That’s pretty much my day.

* At the Grocery Store, I am aware that I don't buy too many things. As you know, grocery stores especially super markets like target, costco, etc. line up so many kinds of items not only groceries and foods but house cleaning tools, pet foods, an so on. It is affordable to buy just fresh meat and veges, but if you buy all other stuff under the sun, some items are more expensive than other stores like hardware stores, electric stores. My advise is not buying all things in super market although I admit it is convinient for busy people who don't want to spend lots of time for shopping. Said that, I often go Costoco for shopping. Because it is a lot of fun for shopping at Costco by finding a good deal, encountering unseen products, and having a very cheap hotdog. The hotdog at Costco is insanly cheap, it costs only 3 bucks including free refill sodas. I know the membership fee is a bit pricy and Costco is placed in suberb rather than city, still there are lots of atractions and nice experience I can feel when I go there. I think I will keep and renew the membership next time.
* offer a wide variety of items
* household cleaning supplies

* What if analysis makes me realize how deeply I understand and can look at the phenomenon from multiple viewpoints. To consider a reasonable senario that other people think it makes sense is similar to a process of building a mathematical model. You have to assume or simplify some aspects of the things, but once you create a model you can change variables and see what would be the expected output. I am not sure what kind of science or academic way to build such a mathematical model, but it is essensially important to understand the phenomenon or system what is behind the scene.
* What-if analysis helps me realize how deeply I understand a phenomenon and how I can view it from multiple perspectives. Considering a reasonable scenario that others find plausible is similar to the process of building a mathematical model. You need to make assumptions or simplify certain aspects, but once the model is created, you can adjust the variables to see the expected outcomes. I'm not sure which scientific or academic discipline specializes in building such models, but it's fundamentally important for understanding the underlying phenomena or systems.
* pausible

* At the Bank. I don't usually go to the bank because I don't need to pull any cash in daily life. Creadit or debit cards (VISA/MASTER) are widely spread and most of shops and restarants (I would say 99%) accept paying by card. There are some stores accept payment only credit or digital. Some say that there are some risks of fraud or scam by registering cards online shopping or showing cards, but personally the same risks can be applicable when you want to withdraw cash using ATMs and insert cards. I saw some TV shows warned a scam technic that scammer put a scamming keyboard on top of the keyboard of ATMs, and steal your card information and security number at the same time. Long story short, I prefer using cards to cash simply because I don't want to spend time to withdraw cash in ATMs and the risks of scaming are almost the same and I think it is just a luck of draw.

While some people worry about the risks of fraud or scams when using cards for online shopping or in-store purchases, I believe the same risks apply when withdrawing cash from ATMs. I've seen TV shows warning about scams where fraudsters place a fake keyboard over the ATM’s, stealing your card information and PIN simultaneously. Long story short, I prefer using cards over cash simply because I don't want to spend time withdrawing money from ATMs, and I think the risks of scams are about the same. It’s just a matter of luck.

* Ipad mini may change my style of studing and chill time. I bought it manily for my kids watching youtube during driving, but I am relly into this device because of its best hand fit size and confort usability. I have alredy witten some journals on ipad mini, and I feel quite nice to write this lying on the sofa. I cannot write and study lying on cauch when I use a laptop, but ipad mini is a device for it. I need to be aware that I shouldnot install apps that distruct studying and keep this device as a productive tool, not for slacking off.
* The iPad Mini may change my study and relaxation habits. I originally bought it mainly for my kids to watch YouTube during drives, but I’ve become really fond of this device because of its perfect hand-held size and comfortable usability. I’ve already written some journal entries on it, and I find it quite nice to write while lying on the sofa. I can’t write or study lying on the couch when I use a laptop, but the iPad Mini is perfect for that. I just need to be mindful not to install apps that might distract me from studying and to keep this device as a productive tool rather than one for slacking off.
* I've become really fond of ...
* need to be mindful
* distract me ...
* rather than one for ...

* I think I can learn many frequentlu used vocaburary and phrases efficiently by reading vocaburary books. But how can I keep acquiring new vocaburary after learning all words and phrases through the books? I think this is something to do with immersion lerning or comprehensive reading that I encounter on youtube videos. Those are basically to get yourself expose into cognitive space that you can image or understand things, and you will be able to acquire vocaburary through the contexst. It makes sense for me that guessing unknown words through context is the natural way to learn vocaburary, and that is the way kids acquire language. 
* similar to how children acquire language.

* Probably I am getting tired and burning out. I need some rest but it is life becoming busy when you are really hard time. If the hardle you have to overcome is proper hight and help you develop your skills, the ordial is going to be experiences. Even if you can't pull it off, it is going to be a good learning for you. Either way, I think putting the hard yard as long as you are not burning out is worth a shot in your life and developing skills in the long run.
* I'm probably getting tired and starting to burn out. I need some rest, but life tends to get busier when you're going through a tough time. If the hurdles you have to overcome are at the right height and help you develop your skills, the ordeal will turn into valuable experience. Even if you don't succeed, it will still be a good learning opportunity. Either way, I think putting in the hard work, as long as you're not burning out, is worth it for your personal growth and skill development in the long run.

* It seems to be good for me to think and write down some memo while I walk on a tread mil machine in the gym in the morning. Every now and then, I need to organize my thoughts and doing it while walking is best way I have ever tried in my life. I can drill down my concerns and ideas while keep my fit, which is like killing two birds with one stone. Still, my presentation and speaking skills especially in English is the thing I need to brush up more. I beliebe Writing journal is a good way to imporove it, but I feel I need write down and get to used to diving deep in my mind. Launguage skill is a part of skill to speak fluently in front of people, but not all. You also need to undderstand your feelings and impressions to express your ideas, which are supposed to be the most valueable and interesting things to hear to other pople.
* Writing down my thoughts while walking on the treadmill in the morning is a great habit for me
* enhance
* diving deeper into my thoughts
* emotions
* as these are often the most valuable and interesting things for others to hear

* Although I have been writing a journal for several months and alreayd forgetting what was the original motivation to do this, I feel my language skill is not to show my ability to speak and understand English, but to convey messages and contribute to other people and team my strength. Thus, I should not focus on grammer and correct expressions. I need to concentrate on how I can tell what I want to say, how I can tell stories easy to understand, what makes myself different opinion to other poeople. That is not only in ENglish, but my ability to express my thoughts in language.
* Although I have been writing a journal for several months, I’ve already forgotten my original motivation for starting. Now, I realize that my language skills are not just about showing my ability to speak and understand English, but about conveying messages and using my strengths to contribute to others and my team. Therefore, I shouldn’t focus solely on grammar and correct expressions. Instead, I need to concentrate on how to clearly express what I want to say, how to tell stories in an easy-to-understand way, and what makes my perspective different from others. This applies not only to English, but to my overall ability to express my thoughts through language.

* I recently feel there is a gap between reality and actual in terms of quality of work and deliveritives. In my mind, I should be able to finish a task more straightforward and better quality, while actual outcome comes slowly and difficult more than I thought. If I can finish off the task quickly and up to snuff, I think that can be said that my productivity is high. For example, a task I did today was just grabbing some data for analysis and required infromation were fully on muy hand. If I can fully concentrate on that, it should have completed within 30mins, but I started other tasks while I wait to download data and ended up doing different thing after several minutes. My problem may be lack of concentration or articulation of priority of tasks, and I believe writing down todo on a list could make me back to the right track even I distructed by anything.
* Lately, I’ve noticed a gap between my expectations and reality when it comes to the quality of my work and deliverables. In my mind, I should be able to complete tasks more efficiently and with higher quality, but in reality, the outcome tends to be slower and more difficult than I anticipated. If I can finish tasks quickly and to a high standard, I would consider myself highly productive. For example, today I had a task that involved gathering data for analysis, and all the required information was at my fingertips. Ideally, I should have completed it within 30 minutes with full focus. However, while waiting for the data to download, I started other tasks, and after a few minutes, I ended up doing something entirely different. My issue may be a lack of concentration or difficulty in prioritizing tasks. I believe that writing a to-do list could help me stay on track, even when I get distracted.

* I think I should spend on my time writing down my thoughts and learnings rather than slacking off by watching a "how to imporove your life" stuff youtube videos. Of course it is important to study how other people succed and apply how it works for you, which is a never ending continuous imporovement. However, I know some idioms like actions is better than thousands of reads or something like that(I don't remember exactly to be honest...). You need to do something directly affecting to the goal or state you are seeking rather than doing anything in roundabout way. That is what I learned when I tried to learn music theory when I played the guitar. What I really wanted to do was improvising using guitar, but what I actually did was learning muysic theory that involves a lot of unnecessary knowleadge when it comes to playing just a guitar, not like pianos. I once remebered all modes on guitar finger board, but I ended up forgetting them after several years. Now I am learning improving by watching play and listen type youtube lesson series, and I am happy to playing blues guitars. I think I have just scrutched the surface, but I wanna maintain this direct acting attitude and be a bluesee daddy.
* I think I should spend my time writing down my thoughts and learnings rather than slacking off by watching “how to improve your life” YouTube videos. Of course, it’s important to study how other people succeed and apply what works for you, as personal growth is a never-ending process. However, I’ve come to realize that actions speak louder than words (or whatever the exact idiom is). You need to focus on tasks that directly move you toward your goals, rather than taking a roundabout approach. I learned this when I was studying music theory while playing guitar. What I really wanted was to improvise, but I ended up diving into music theory, which involved a lot of knowledge that wasn’t necessary for just playing guitar—unlike instruments like the piano. I once memorized all the modes on the guitar fretboard, but I forgot them after a few years. Now, I’m learning by watching “play and listen” YouTube lessons, and I’m enjoying playing blues guitar. I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface, but I want to keep this direct approach and eventually become a true blues player.
* I've come to realize that actions speak louder than words 

* I have written real diary for the first time. It was actually for a kind of exhange diary within the same class in a childcare, but I needed to leave how our family stayed during weekend with staffed toys. I might be able to complete the entory by myself, but I used chatGPT to help me wording it. I was completely exhausted due to long walking, and didn't have time to think on the diary. I made some bullet points memo and asked chatgpt create a nice entory texts for diary. It sounded really fun and cherfull. I thought one of strength of chatgpt could be like this. Creating a ligit and decent sentenses without taking too much effort. Some people might think that you are no brainer that I didn't come up with any creative thing, but at least I input the fundamental or core message I wanted to tell and it is not a story made up by AI. I just asked someone to help me out the wording of it. It is like a realtion between book editer and author I suppose. Although I have never written a book.
* I wrote a real diary entry for the first time. It was actually for an exchange diary within my childcare class, and I needed to describe how our family spent the weekend with stuffed toys. While I could have completed the entry by myself, I used ChatGPT to help me with the wording. I was completely exhausted from a long walk and didn’t have time to think through the diary carefully. So, I made a few bullet points and asked ChatGPT to create a well-written entry based on them. The result sounded fun and cheerful, and it made me realize that one of ChatGPT’s strengths is creating legitimate and polished sentences without requiring much effort. Some people might think it’s uncreative or lazy, but I still provided the core message I wanted to convey. It wasn’t an AI-made story—it was my input, just worded with a little help. It feels like the relationship between a book editor and an author, even though I’ve never written a book myself.

* I am stressed due to lots of work and things to do. It is my own fault that I cannot turn down an offer or help someone need. My first priority is to help team, but I also have my own work. Thus, I tend to precrinate my work a bit or sometimes really miss the ball. I know this kind of sacrificing myself doens't make me no where, however, in a certen view point, I contribute the productivity of our team and it should be efficient in the long run. I don't regretting it. I keep helping people out.
* I am feeling stressed due to the large amount of work and tasks I need to manage. It's my own fault that I struggle to turn down requests or offers to help others. My first priority is to support the team, but I also have my own responsibilities. As a result, I tend to procrastinate on my own work or sometimes completely drop the ball. I know that sacrificing myself in this way won’t get me anywhere, but from a certain perspective, I contribute to the team's productivity, which should be beneficial in the long run. I don’t regret it and will continue helping others.
* I feel stressed

* I was stopping drinking for a while for dieting. I realized that how alcohol distruct your concentration and sleep, and increase apetite by comparing the day when I drink and the day I don't. Probably, it is advisable to drink only Friday or Saturday because you can sleep more on Saturday and you don't have to wake up early in the morning.
* I stopped drinking for a while as part of my diet. I realized how alcohol disrupts concentration and sleep, and increases appetite by comparing the days when I drink with the days I don't. It's probably best to drink only on Fridays or Saturdays, since you can sleep in on Saturday and don’t need to wake up early.

* I see many people says it is heart and soul to acquire new vocaburary through contexts when it comes to learning a language. I think it is correct, but the problem is how you find books or contents that are well balanced in proper level of your language skill and your interests. When I started reading books written in English, I could easiliy find easy reading books, but most of them are too childish and bored to read them. On the other hand, I started reading Harry potter series books, I felt they are quite interesting to read, but my english level wasn't enough to understand the contents without dictionary. In the end, seeking an interesting content is never ending journy and you must be doing it even in your mother tongue. 
* I often hear that acquiring new vocabulary through context is the heart and soul of language learning. I agree with this, but the challenge lies in finding books or content that strike the right balance between matching your language level and keeping your interest. When I first started reading English books, it was easy to find simpler material, but most of it felt too childish and boring. On the other hand, when I began reading the Harry Potter series, I found it fascinating, but my English skills weren’t strong enough to fully understand the content without constantly referring to a dictionary. In the end, finding engaging content is a never-ending journey, even in your native language.

* Since I started journaling, I am now able to construct sentences a bit freely compared to before, but I don't feel the same fluentcy as I speak and think in my mother tongue. To improve more, what should I practice or do? I am seeking by watching some youtube videos, but I haven't met a decisive way yet. Still, I think journaling and reading books are fundamental training or habits when it comes to acquiring fluencty. Thus, I will maintain those habits but explore ways to get different feelings or excitements to improve my english more sophisticated and sounds interesting.

* We had a friend coming from Japan for the first time since we came here. We didn't know what to do for a visiter, but we wanted to do our best to welcome a person who spent time and money to meet us. We are simply happy to meet acquiretances in remote area and share information what is going on in Japan and the difference between two countries. I should have talked more to chat. I will try next time and want to make his visit impressive and enjoy.

We weren’t sure what to do for a visitor, but we wanted to do our best to welcome someone who had spent time and money to come see us. We were simply happy to meet an acquaintance in such a distant place, share news about what’s happening in Japan, and discuss the differences between the two countries. I should have talked more during the visit. I’ll make an effort next time to make their visit more memorable and enjoyable.

* I realized that drinking is not so effective for reliving stress. Some people say that they can forget about concers and feel like revelated by drinking, but I think it make your sleep level lower and even cause more stress in the long run. Also, by looking at the sleep level score that my garmine watch measure, the score when I drunk the last night is tend to lower than that of when I didn't. I recently avoid buying beer or wine bottles unneccesarry, and I feel really better than before.
* I realized that drinking is not very effective for relieving stress. Some people say they can forget their worries and feel relaxed after drinking, but I think it actually lowers the quality of sleep and causes more stress in the long run. Based on the sleep score measured by my Garmin watch, I’ve noticed that my sleep score after drinking tends to be lower than when I don’t drink. Recently, I’ve been avoiding unnecessary purchases of beer or wine, and I feel much better than before.

* It is important to try to describe complex objects or abstruct things even if you fail to convey your messages. Challenging is the first step and only regret left if you don't try. Of-course there are some extreme situations that you should not challenge like time-sensitive situation or easy-to-fire-up client, but by and large, I think you should try most of situations. Thus, I will keep trying to describe things off the top of my head.
* It’s important to try describing complex or abstract ideas, even if you fail to convey your message. Taking on the challenge is the first step, and the only regret comes from not trying. Of course, there are extreme situations, like time-sensitive matters or easily agitated clients, where it’s best not to take risks, but in most cases, I believe you should make the effort. Therefore, I will keep trying to describe things as they come to mind.

* I have been working on a qutie complex task that requirs to estimate the value or effectiveness of dynamic resouce allocation. It is something to do with the famous mathematical problem that a salesman finds the most cost effective route to get around the customers. The difficult thing for me is to create a what-if senario that could have been achieved somehow and compare it with the actual past data. An idea I came up so far is counting chances to allocate a recouce to another when one is suspended situation. In the situation, the resouce could have gone somewhere. I need to make the idea more substantial and calculatable, but I wanna ask chatGPT whether this kind of analysis or predition are existing in practical field.
* I have been working on a quite complex task that requires estimating the value or effectiveness of dynamic resource allocation. It relates to the well-known mathematical problem where a salesman must find the most cost-effective route to visit customers. The challenge for me is to create a ‘what-if’ scenario that could have been realized in some way and compare it with actual past data. One idea I’ve come up with so far is to count the opportunities to allocate a resource elsewhere when it is in a suspended state. In this scenario, the resource could have been redirected. I need to develop this idea further to make it more concrete and measurable, but I’d like to ask ChatGPT if this type of analysis or prediction exists in practical applications

* Some people say that Costco is not cost effective at all because you tend to end up buying not only necessary grosseries but also some nice-to-have items. I think buying unplanned items is applicable for any other supermarkets too, but I agree that consumers are sometimes forced to purchase items over the top amount. Bulk shopping is the strength of Costco for the people who really like the product and want to get them with good deal, but it is a double edged sword as well. Especially, if you are not familier with the products or if it is unhealth food, you might end up throwing away most of the portion of them due to health or taste perspective and it's completely waste of money. I think it is alway good to create a shopping list when you go grocery shopping wherever you go Costco, or any other supermarkets.
* Some people argue that Costco isn’t cost-effective because you often end up buying not only the groceries you need but also some “nice-to-have” items. While I think this tendency applies to any supermarket, I agree that consumers can sometimes feel compelled to buy more than they need. Bulk shopping is a benefit of Costco for people who really like a product and want to get a good deal, but it can also be a double-edged sword. Especially if you’re not familiar with the products or if they are unhealthy, you might end up throwing away a large portion of them due to health concerns or simply not liking the taste, which is a complete waste of money. I believe it’s always a good idea to create a shopping list before grocery shopping, whether you’re going to Costco or any other supermarket.

* Until I moved to here, I didn't know that Karubi is Japanese or Korean and not an english word to say a part of meat. In english spoken countries, Karubi is sold as short ribs. Also, it is not sliced thin, but thin I think it is for texis bbq style. I have never seen Harami in this counry too. maybe Flap or something along those lines is equibvalent to harami. I wonder where I can get the part too.
* Until I moved here, I didn’t realize that “Karubi” is a Japanese or Korean term and not an English word for a cut of meat. In English-speaking countries, Karubi is sold as short ribs. It’s also not sliced thinly like it is in Japan or Korea, probably because it’s prepared for Texas BBQ style. I haven’t seen Harami here either. Perhaps “flap meat” or something similar is equivalent to Harami. I wonder where I can find that cut.
* cut of meat
* thinly

* I don't seem to be able to diet since I cannot stand eating less especially dinner time. I know making your body carories deficite is the fundamental to lose fat. I have been walking for thirty minuteis in the morning, and I lose 3kg, but I cannot get over the next 2kg for a while. I think I have reached some tipping point or satulated point that just excersicing can't move forward anymore. Probably, if I walk more, I will lose a bit, but I think it is about time to start thinking of food I take everyday.
* I’ve been struggling to stick to a diet because I find it hard to eat less, especially at dinner. I know creating a calorie deficit is key to losing fat. I’ve been walking for 30 minutes every morning and have lost 3kg, but I’ve been stuck for a while trying to lose the next 2kg. I think I’ve hit a tipping point or plateau where exercise alone isn’t enough anymore. If I walk more, I might lose a bit, but I feel like it’s time to start focusing on my daily food intake.

* I used statistical modeling method in practical analysis for the first time. It was a wating time data and the data should be able to fit with exponential distoribution typically. I had no idea how and when those kinds of distoribution are used in real analysis, but there were up front of my nose. What I did with the model was simply what-if analysis that assuming distribution shape chages are happened in certen situation. Still, I need a crystal ball to forsee the future, but at least I got some interesting results that could make sense for the business dicisions.
* I used a statistical modeling method in a practical analysis for the first time. The dataset involved waiting times, which are typically expected to fit an exponential distribution. I wasn’t familiar with how or when these types of distributions are applied in real-world analysis, but they were right in front of me. What I did with the model was a simple what-if analysis, assuming that changes in the distribution shape occur under certain conditions. I still need a crystal ball to foresee the future, but at least I got some interesting results that could inform business decisions.

* I need to make use of my precious time to things that will lead productive or worthwhile in the long run. Sometimes I spend time by looking around unnecessary portal pages to find something interesting, but I need to be careful that will go nowhere. It is good to know something sounds or looks but maybe useful in the future, but it is also important to think how much I spend for that.
* I need to make better use of my time by focusing on activities that will be productive or worthwhile in the long run. Sometimes I find myself browsing unnecessary web pages, looking for something interesting, but I need to be cautious as that leads nowhere. It’s good to learn things that might be useful in the future, but it’s also important to consider how much time I’m spending on them.
* I find myself browsing unnecessary web pages

* I feel gaps of the speed and quality of work between what I am thinking to be suppose to be and what I really can do. In my image, it is clear what I need to do, but it actually takes much more time to do it than I thought. I wish I had more time, but at the same time I need to rest and want to spend time with my family more. I am between rock and hard. What am I suppose to do to jaggle work and home at the same time?
* I feel a gap between the speed and quality of work I expect from myself and what I can actually achieve. In my mind, I have a clear image of what needs to be done, but it always takes much longer than I anticipated. I wish I had more time, but I also need rest and want to spend more time with my family. I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. How am I supposed to juggle both work and home life at the same time?

* Listening podcasts are definitely good to immerse yourself to the language world that you want to acquire and help you build conprehention effectively. Especially, by combining open-ear headphones, you can listen contents without feeling stress. For example, when you want to listen music or podcasts with noise-cancelling headphones while you cook, you will find that cooking sounds are really important clues to know the timing of cooking phase. Like boiling water bubbling sound, sizzling grilled sound, beeping from microwave, etc. You need those sound as you cook to lay of the land and status of pans and oven. Open ear type headsets allows us to hear those important notice to cook as well as the contents you want to listen. Of course, you need to be aware that too much attention to the contens you listen while you do other thing might cause some dengerous situation, but by and large, I think listening podcasts you want to learn while you do house chores are really effective way to make use your time. let's kill two birds with one stone.
* Listening to podcasts is definitely a great way to immerse yourself in the language you’re trying to acquire, helping you build comprehension effectively. Especially with open-ear headphones, you can listen to content without feeling stressed. For instance, when you use noise-cancelling headphones to listen to music or podcasts while cooking, you might realize that the sounds of cooking are essential cues for the timing of each phase. Sounds like bubbling water, sizzling from the grill, or beeping from the microwave are crucial for understanding what’s happening with your food. Open-ear headphones allow you to hear these important sounds while still enjoying the content you’re listening to. Of course, you need to be mindful that focusing too much on the content could lead to dangerous situations, but overall, I think listening to podcasts while doing household chores is an effective way to make the most of your time. Let’s kill two birds with one stone.

* I am gonna go to bed. I need to rest to work on the task that really important for me.

* Today I think I saw a very important youtube video that mentioned the process to acquire vocaburary through contexts and difference between learning and acquiring. I experienced a lot similar to learn words or expression through frequent words books but hardly can remember. On the other hand, when I worked I encounter a word that was unheard of for me, but I still remember the momeent and the situation, and the word became active vocaburary of mine immidiately. I wanted to do the same experience to increase vocaburary, but I can hardly experience it when I watch youtube videos, listening podcasts. How can I do that?
* Today, I watched a very important YouTube video that explained the process of acquiring vocabulary through context and highlighted the difference between learning and acquiring. I’ve had similar experiences where I tried to learn words or expressions using vocabulary books but struggled to remember them. On the other hand, when I encountered an unfamiliar word while working, I could recall the moment and situation vividly, and the word immediately became part of my active vocabulary. I want to replicate this experience to expand my vocabulary, but I find it difficult to do so when watching YouTube videos or listening to podcasts. How can I achieve this?

* Even though I listen a lot of podcasts and youtube videos, I don't feel like my vocaburary has been increased drastically. I believe the change will be gradual and unnotisable not like when you were a bigginer. What I need is patince to stick to this strategy and expose myself as long as possible. That's my beliefe.
* Even though I listen to a lot of podcasts and YouTube videos, I don’t feel like my vocabulary has increased drastically. I believe the change will be gradual and less noticeable, unlike when I was a beginner. What I need is patience to stick to this strategy and expose myself to the language as much as possible. That’s my belief.

* Listening to a car reviewing podcast is one of my favorite time recently. I have leased a car, but I want to get my own car if all things are settled in here. I am not sure everything will work well, still it will be what it will be. 
* Listening to car review podcasts has become one of my favorite pastimes recently. I’ve leased a car, but I want to get my own once everything is settled here. I’m not sure how things will work out, but it will be what it will be.

* I talked to students since long time. When I was in Japan, I used to be a recruter and talked with students or new grads every year. Every time when I have conversation to them, I realize that how it is difficult to explain myself and my work plainly. Unlike introducting yourself to your client or other team, you don't need to intoroduce the indastory itself as it is obvious. However, when you talk about yourself to students, you need to be aware that they do not know anything about your industory you are working. It makes me a bird eye view to see my work from third person's view point. Kind of Meta perspective.
* I recently talked to students after a long time. When I was in Japan, I used to be a recruiter and would speak with students or new graduates every year. Every time I have conversations with them, I realize how difficult it is to explain myself and my work in simple terms. Unlike introducing yourself to clients or other teams, where you don’t need to explain the industry because it’s understood, when you talk to students, you have to keep in mind that they may know nothing about the industry you’re working in. This gives me a bird’s-eye view, allowing me to see my work from a third-person perspective—a kind of meta-perspective.

* I know I need to be more calm and talk slowly when I speak, but I feel a pear pressure that I have to talk the same speed as the other people do. Eventually, my grammer or expressions aren't be so sofisticated and everybody may hardly understand what I say correctly. I don't know this is the process every language learners pass, but I have got to leave this stage as soon as possible because it is so stressfull for me not to be able to convery my opnions.
* I know I need to stay calm and speak slowly, but I feel pressured to match the speaking speed of others. As a result, my grammar and expressions often aren’t very sophisticated, and people may have trouble understanding me clearly. I’m not sure if this is something every language learner goes through, but I feel I need to move past this stage as soon as possible because it’s so stressful not being able to convey my opinions properly.

* I found keycaps play very important role when it comes to experience in mechanical keyboard. I like low profile keyboard because of its thinner height that doesn't need a palm rest. However, the only complaint for low profile keyboard was the flat keytops and that cause a lot of miss type. Lukeyly, I found the kaihl v2 or some new low profile switches are allow to put usual MX type keycaps on them, so I am now trying how it feels with MT3 profile keytops that was collecting dust in my stock box. So far, I feel a bit of striking botton feeling that is not the stroke end of switches, but at least it works and I feel better as I don't misstype so much compared to when I use the original flat keytops. I might end up buying the usual MX type keyaboard, but I will see.
* I’ve realized that keycaps play a very important role in the experience of using a mechanical keyboard. I like low-profile keyboards because their thinner height doesn’t require a palm rest. However, my main complaint with low-profile keyboards has been the flat keycaps, which cause a lot of mistyping. Fortunately, I found that the Kaihl V2 and some new low-profile switches allow the use of standard MX-type keycaps. So, I’m currently trying out MT3 profile keycaps that were collecting dust in my stash. So far, I’m noticing a bit of a bottoming-out feeling, though it’s not at the end of the switch’s stroke. Still, it works, and I’m mistyping less compared to when I used the original flat keycaps. I might eventually switch to a standard MX-type keyboard, but I’ll see how this goes.

* I've realized a quite normal thing that zoom lens are convinient when it comes to shooting photos for family in busy place like zoos. We went to a zoo in our area for the first time and I brought my camera this time to record family photos beautifuly. I usually bring single focul lens as I am not good at diciding the focus distance before taking phones and I have too many choices when taking photos with zoom lens. However, I didn't concentrated or actually have time to consider compositions when taking photos since it was too busy to look after our child, I realized zoom lens is quite easy to take photos without changing the distance between me and the ojbects. I know I should try and consider lots of composition, but I think there is nothing more important than taking photos and leaving memories than no photos or raging family.
* I’ve realized something quite simple: zoom lenses are convenient for taking family photos in busy places like zoos. We recently visited our local zoo for the first time, and I brought my camera along to capture beautiful family moments. Normally, I prefer using a prime lens because I struggle with choosing the right focal length on a zoom lens. With so many options, it can be overwhelming. However, this time I didn’t have much time to think about composition or focus, as I was too busy looking after our child. That’s when I realized how easy it is to use a zoom lens, allowing me to take photos without constantly adjusting my distance from the subject. While I know it’s important to experiment with different compositions, I think the most important thing is capturing memories, even if the photos aren’t perfect—better that than no photos or a frustrated family.

* Time management is one of the thing I need to work on to make use of precious time in here. I don't have unlimited time that I can stay here, so I want to spend as effectively and productive as possible. Pomodoro timer is a thing I brought from my home, which is a timer simply say. I use this when I want to set a limit to do a specific thing but I don't wnat to lots of time, like drafting an email. You can think over the email texts and how to convery your messages, but sometimes I spend too much time to just to send information, but the way or grammer is not so important. In such case, I set a timer for 30mins and declar me I would do this just 30mins.
* Time management is one of the areas I need to work on to make the most of my time here. I don’t have unlimited time, so I want to be as effective and productive as possible. One tool I brought with me is a Pomodoro timer, which is just a simple timer. I use it when I need to set a time limit for a specific task but don’t want to spend too much time on it, like drafting an email. It’s easy to overthink the wording and how to convey your message, but sometimes I end up spending too much time on something where grammar or phrasing isn’t that critical. In such cases, I set the timer for 30 minutes and commit to finishing the task within that time.
* make most of time

* I bought a new pair of shoes for daily casual use. The last ones I used were kind of flagship model of adidas, and it did great job for daily commuting, gym training, walking, baseball, and so on. The only reason I bought new ones is simply it worning out. The right shoe outer has been torn and my 4th toe finger coming out from the shoe. I know highend shoes are expensive, but they are really comfy when you select shoes by not brand name, but quality and fuctionality. This shoes might be most expensive shoes I have ever bought for sneeker, but I use them literally everyday for gym walking, so I didn't want to compromise the queality and don't regret buying it. 
* I bought a new pair of shoes for everyday casual use. My previous pair was a flagship model from Adidas, and they served me well for daily commuting, gym workouts, walking, baseball, and more. The only reason I replaced them was because they were simply worn out. The outer side of the right shoe had torn, and my fourth toe was starting to poke through. I know high-end shoes can be expensive, but they’re worth it if you focus on quality and functionality rather than just the brand name. These are probably the most expensive sneakers I’ve ever bought, but since I use them daily for the gym and walking, I didn’t want to compromise on quality, and I have no regrets about the purchase.
* purchase
* poke out, poke through

* The public pool I went today was way better than the one we went last week because of the low usage fee and its layout. First, it was cheaper but the quality of the facility was not bad. Acutally, the swiming pool for adults is longer than the one we went last week. Also, there are bunch of kids areas that could be devided by baby to toddoler, kids, and big kids. It also had a warm pool that babies and toddlers could get used to water there. I will go the again cause it is closer compared to go to the nearest sea and low price.
* The public pool I went to today was much better than the one we visited last week because of its low usage fee and layout. First, it was cheaper, but the quality of the facility wasn’t bad at all. In fact, the adult swimming pool was longer than the one we went to last week. There were also several kids’ areas divided into sections for babies, toddlers, kids, and older children. It even had a warm pool where babies and toddlers could get used to the water. I’ll definitely go there again since it’s closer than the nearest beach and reasonably priced.

* I tried kinda like texas bbq for the first time today. My wife friend family brough a nice chunk of fillet and I grilled it with a charcoal bbq grill. At first, I grilled all suface not become charr but nice enough to make it caramerize. Next, cover the meat with foil and put on the area of the grill where the heat didn't come direct but warm enough that could make the center part of meat 56 degrees celcious that is considered to be a medium rare outcome as a rule of thumb. I put it for almost 40mins and the result was really nice tender and flavorfull meat. I don't usually try such a texas style bbq, but I thought I should do it more often that I can serve a nice dish when friends come over my place.
* I tried something like Texas BBQ for the first time today. My wife’s friend’s family brought a nice chunk of fillet, and I grilled it on a charcoal BBQ. First, I seared all the surfaces, making sure it didn’t char but caramelized nicely. Then, I covered the meat with foil and placed it on the part of the grill where it wasn’t getting direct heat but was warm enough to cook the center to 56°C, which is considered medium-rare as a general rule. I left it for almost 40 minutes, and the result was tender, flavorful meat. I don’t usually try Texas-style BBQ, but I think I should do it more often so I can serve a nice dish when friends come over.

* Probably, talking to chatGPT could eliminate all kind of english speaking platforms like native camp. I used to use native camp for 2years when I was in Japan, but as far as I tested for 15mins talking to it, I felt the conversation with chatGPT was almost the same experience for me. Same as you talk to people, you need to clarify the point you want to convey and listen to the things people talking to you. I was almost the same awkwardness when I talk to people, and it is amazing. However, there were several differences I felt as well; you can't talk while other pople are talking and ChatGPT automatically recognize the stop of my talking while I was just stuck how to say. It needs a little bit to get used to the tones or way to talk, overall, I will use to practice English speaking. 
* Talking to ChatGPT might replace many English-speaking platforms, like Native Camp. I used Native Camp for two years when I was in Japan, but after just 15 minutes of talking to ChatGPT, I felt the experience was almost the same. Just like when you talk to people, you need to clarify your points and listen carefully to what the other person is saying. I even felt the same kind of awkwardness I usually experience when speaking with others, which is amazing! However, there were some differences I noticed: for example, you can’t speak while the other person is talking, and ChatGPT automatically recognizes when I pause because I’m stuck on how to say something. It takes a bit of time to get used to the tone and the flow of the conversation, but overall, I think it’s a great tool for practicing English speaking.

* Still I think journaling is a solid way to enhance my ability of speaking English. Although there are lots of ways to imporove language fluency and I think journaling is one of the easiest way compared to other methods, like speaking to people, using speaking apps, and writing esseis. The efficiency of journaling when it comes to enahancing the agility to speak may be a bit inferier to other methods, but I think the easy to start at the same time easy to keep is the strongest advantage of journaling. Let's see how many months and years I can keep this habit.
* I still believe that journaling is a solid way to improve my English-speaking skills. There are many ways to enhance language fluency, and I think journaling is one of the easiest compared to methods like talking to people, using speaking apps, or writing essays. While journaling might be slightly less effective in boosting speaking agility compared to other methods, its greatest advantage is how easy it is to start and maintain. Let’s see how many months or years I can keep up this habit.

* I have been busy since this week. I don't want to compromise the quality of work and lots of things I want to learn by reviewing the videos or materials, but simply I don't have time. At the same time I don't have enough energy to put the hard yard at night to catch up to close the gap between my ideal and current my state. That's the way cokky crables and it is what it is.
* I’ve been busy since the start of this week. I don’t want to compromise the quality of my work, and there’s so much I want to learn by reviewing videos and materials, but I just don’t have enough time. At the same time, I lack the energy to put in the hard work at night to close the gap between my ideal and current state. That’s the way the cookie crumbles, and it is what it is

* I Ended up buying a new custom keyboard that is 65% MX switch type. I used a low profile keayboard for home desk environment, but I couldn't get used to the flat keycaps that causes mistypes to type different keys compared to deep scurupted MX type key caps. In the end, I think what I like for mechanical keyboards is the QMK customization and deep scrputure key caps. Especially MT3 profile keycaps are amazing for its somewhat addictive type feeling. I also like the current keychron original high hight keacaps, but I will try to change to MT2. Let's see how the feeling is different and which or both are fine for me.
* I ended up buying a new custom keyboard with 65% layout and MX switches. I used a low-profile keyboard for my home desk setup, but I couldn’t get used to the flat keycaps, which caused me to mistype compared to the deeper, sculpted MX keycaps. In the end, I think what I like most about mechanical keyboards is the QMK customization and deep-sculpted keycaps. The MT3 profile keycaps are especially amazing for their somewhat addictive typing feel. I also like the current Keychron high-profile keycaps, but I’ll try switching to MT2 soon. Let’s see how the feel compares and if either—or both—work well for me.

* Swtiming in pool and chilling in the pool side are pleasant time for me. It is not common for ordinally people living in an apartment or house to have pool in the premise, swiming in the pool shared in the apartment was amazing attraction for our family. Not only a swiming pool for adult, there are jagsees and shallow pool for kids. I was not good at swiming in the first year when I came this country, but I kept practicing swiming in the ppol and now I became be able to swim almost 200meters without breaks, which is way big advancement for me.
* Swimming in the pool and relaxing by the poolside is a pleasant time for me. It’s not common for most people living in an apartment or house to have a pool on the premises, so having access to the shared apartment pool has been an amazing attraction for our family. Not only is there a swimming pool for adults, but there are also jacuzzis and a shallow pool for kids. In my first year in this country, I wasn’t very good at swimming, but I kept practicing, and now I can swim almost 200 meters without breaks, which is a huge improvement for me.

* I palyed baseball until when I was a junior high-school student and I was a catcher position. I was also good at hitting so I was assigned the first batter from the coach. Looking back, I was absessed with stregthen my muscles, but I didn't want to spend a lot of time to practice unnecessary and losing my leasure time for other things, which made myself decide not to stick to play baseball in high school. However, I played again and I found myself I like baseball when I play it not too much pressures and enjoying.

Looking back, I was obsessed with strengthening my muscles, but I didn’t want to spend too much time practicing and losing my leisure time for other things. That’s what made me decide not to continue playing baseball in high school. However, I played again and realized I still enjoy baseball when there’s no pressure and it’s just for fun.

* I am thinking to buy several toys as a small gift for when my kid friend comes over my house. Most of the children came my house were interested in mobility like trucks, cars, etc. So I thought it would be nice to give my comanies minitures as present for them to say thank you for coming my house.
* I’m thinking of buying a few toys as small gifts for when my child’s friends come over to my house. Most of the kids who visit seem to be interested in vehicles like trucks and cars, so I thought it would be nice to give them miniature versions of my company’s models as a way to say thank you for coming.

* Reading books are one of habits that I manage to maintain to study. As I read English books, it could be double dipping results to imporove my ability of English and the things I could learn from them. Having said that, the reading speed is definitely slower than the books written in Japanese. However, I believe the more I spend time to read books written in English, the quicker and the cleveler I will be able to read.
* Reading books is one habit I’ve managed to maintain for studying. By reading English books, I get the double benefit of improving my English skills and learning from the content itself. That said, my reading speed is definitely slower than when I read books in Japanese. However, I believe that the more time I spend reading in English, the faster and more efficiently I’ll be able to read.

* I binged squid game on netflix recent several days. I knew the story is similar to Kaiji, gambling for huge amount of money on behalf of oneself life. Essentially, it is a human drama in an extreme situation of confusion between gready wanting to money and self-esteem or virtues. I think the biggest difference between Kaiji and Squid gaim is the operation side scenes like cheating doctor and young police man sneaking and disguising as an opoeration staff. That makes me bring third person perspective to enjoy the drama. The other difference is that the main charactor was won in Squid game while Kaiji never win or satisfied to the previous wins. We'll see how the season 2 of squid game is going. I enjoyed a lot anyways.
* I binged Squid Game on Netflix over the past few days. I knew the story was similar to Kaiji, where characters gamble huge amounts of money at the risk of their lives. At its core, it’s a human drama set in an extreme situation, where greed for money clashes with self-esteem and moral values. I think the biggest difference between Kaiji and Squid Game is the inclusion of scenes from the operation side, like the doctor involved in cheating and the young policeman sneaking in disguised as staff. This adds a third-person perspective that deepens the drama. Another difference is that the main character wins in Squid Game, while in Kaiji, he never fully wins or feels satisfied with his past victories. I’m looking forward to seeing how Season 2 of Squid Game turns out. I really enjoyed it!

* I am gradually becoming to understand how to acquire vocaburary through contexts when it comes to learning language. I read some book written in English, but I might have been a bit too early to read novels for older kids like harry potter series. Well known language resercher said that the best ocmprehension state to immerse yourself the world of a book is above 90% to understand the vocaburary you already know. And I think my comprehension was almost like 60 to 80% when I was reading Harry potter books. Now I read Darren shane series, I feel like I am more into the world and encounter lots of idioms and expressions that I barely understand and I can feel those anbiguous expressions are becoming my part of vocaburary.
* I’m gradually starting to understand how to acquire vocabulary through context in language learning. I’ve read some English books, but I may have jumped into novels for older kids, like the Harry Potter series, a bit too soon. A well-known language researcher mentioned that the best comprehension level to fully immerse yourself in a book’s world is when you already understand over 90% of the vocabulary. I think my comprehension was more around 60-80% when reading Harry Potter. Now, as I read the Darren Shan series, I feel more immersed and often come across idioms and expressions I barely understand, but I can sense these ambiguous phrases gradually becoming part of my vocabulary.

* The taks I am currently working on might be the most enjoyable task for me. I am so excited to create valuable insights from it that I didn't notice I was overtime.

* Wine is a my favorite alcohol drink, but I don't like the headache and hangover after drink it. Especially I love drinking red wine while I eat thick meat like steak. I used to buy box wine as daily go-to drinking, but recentlly I don't drink so much because I started dieting. Drinking make you more appatite and in result you end up eating more than enough.
* Wine is my favorite alcoholic drink, but I don’t like the headache and hangover that come after drinking it. I especially love drinking red wine with hearty meat dishes like steak. I used to buy boxed wine as my go-to daily drink, but recently I’ve cut back because I started dieting. Drinking tends to increase your appetite, and as a result, you often end up eating more than you need.

* I am stressed out because of the busyness and less appetite. It is a favarable for me to lose weight, but I don't want to lose my mustle a lot, so I need to eat necessary energ and nutrition adequately. However, I sometimes don't have time to eat lunch. like today. there was a hallowin party in the office and I ate lots of sweet snacks like soft candy and chocolates. I ended up not eating lunch cause I didn't feel hungry at all. This week is defenitely exceptionally busy week for me. I am looking forward to resting on this weekend.
* I’m feeling stressed due to my busy schedule and low appetite. It helps with my weight loss goals, but I don’t want to lose too much muscle, so I need to make sure I’m getting enough energy and nutrition. However, I sometimes don’t have time to eat lunch, like today. There was a Halloween party at the office, and I ate a lot of sweet snacks like candy and chocolate, so I didn’t feel hungry for lunch. This week has definitely been exceptionally busy, and I’m looking forward to resting this weekend.

* I attempted talking to chatGPT while I drove today, and it was not bad experience at all. Of-course there was feeling that I was talking to system or robot, which is definitely not human, but I was not bored to talk it. I can say it is way better experience in talking than previous age speak AI such as google speaker and Siri.
* I tried talking to ChatGPT while I was driving today, and it wasn’t a bad experience at all. Of course, I could tell I was talking to a system or robot, not a human, but I didn’t feel bored. I’d say it’s a much better experience than previous-generation voice AIs like Google Assistant and Siri.

* Describing things might be the best way to brush up my English speaking. When I was asked ChatGPT to answer some questions regarding Fishing, I needed to explain fishing tackes like reel, rod, lures, etc, I answered it not only I knew or not, but also explained what it is. It was good excersize for me to describe the objet I know with different words and expressions. I want to keep this practice with chatgpt.
* Describing things might be the best way to improve my English speaking skills. When I asked ChatGPT to answer some questions about fishing, I had to explain fishing tackle like reels, rods, lures, etc. I answered not only based on what I knew but also by describing what each item is. It was a good exercise to use different words and expressions to describe objects I’m familiar with. I want to keep practicing this with ChatGPT.”

* I spent productive this weekend. I bit the bullet and cleaned the balcony up where was covered with ash and charcoal pitch due to BBQ. I use rottating mop for cleaning the balcony floor ususally, but I used just a brush and cleaning cloth this time. It wasn't a bad decision because switching the work between wipping the dust first and wiping with cloth was much easier than when I use rottating mop that only does wiping job and not good at sweeping. After cleaning up the balcony, I went my friend house to have a lunch and chatted him about 2 or 3 hours. It was fun. Finnaly, I went to the pool in apartment and swam for 15mins. I swam almost 500 meters and it was my longest swiming record. I am becoming sleeply...
* I had a productive weekend. I finally bit the bullet and cleaned the balcony, which was covered in ash and charcoal from barbecues. I usually use a rotating mop for the balcony floor, but this time I just used a brush and cleaning cloth. It turned out to be a good choice because alternating between dusting and wiping was much easier than using the mop, which is only good for wiping, not sweeping. After cleaning the balcony, I went to a friend’s house for lunch and chatted with him for 2-3 hours. It was fun! Finally, I went to the apartment pool and swam for 15 minutes, covering nearly 500 meters—my longest swim yet. Now I’m feeling sleepy…

* It has been a while I started jounaling, but I still struggle summonrn english expressions quickly in a daily conversatin. I know I need to practice and practice, but I wonder if there is an effective and quick way to imporove the fluency and flow of my english.
* It’s been a while since I started journaling, but I still struggle to quickly summon English expressions in daily conversation. I know I need to keep practicing, but I wonder if there’s an effective and quick way to improve my fluency and flow in English.

* I realized that Walking at night is pleasant especially when I have been drunken. Lots of things you don't know much could be seen when you walk without any purpose. Also, it should help reduce a bit of calories I took when I drink, which makes me reduce a bit of guilty when I eat too much.
* I’ve realized that walking at night is especially pleasant when I’ve had a few drinks. When you walk without a specific purpose, you notice things you might usually overlook. Plus, it helps burn a few of the extra calories from drinking, which eases some of the guilt when I overindulge.

* I am still underestimate the work time of me. Tasks I imagine easy to do takes almost double as I thought, which makes me drive me nuts due to the gap of the fact.
* I still tend to underestimate the time my work will take. Tasks I expect to be easy often take almost twice as long as I’d imagined, which drives me nuts because of the gap between my expectations and reality.”

* I found that Notion is very convinient when it comes to summarizing, organizing, and sharing studies or reserches. For instance, I have used notion for a travel planning, which typically involves lots of reserching on google, and bunch of booking emails. Notion can easily organize such information by relating one information to another like creating a web page, but not time taking. It is so efficient to share the well-organized travel plan and putting together my partner's ideas on top of that. I will keep using the app.
* “I found that Notion is incredibly convenient for summarizing, organizing, and sharing studies or research. For instance, I used Notion for travel planning, which typically involves a lot of Google searches and multiple booking emails. Notion easily organizes this information by linking related details, almost like creating a webpage, but without taking too much time. It’s also efficient for sharing a well-organized travel plan and adding my partner’s ideas on top of it. I’ll definitely keep using the app.”

* I did fishing since for a while. I coudn't catch any fish, but it was so pleasant to hang around river banks in the morning. 
* I went fishing for the first time in a while. I didn’t catch anything, but it was so pleasant to spend the morning by the riverbanks.

* I am stressed out now because there are too many things to do while I don't have enough time and skill to juggle them productively. I think I am not cut out for a multi-tasking and I would rather focus on digging deep a specific thing. maybe becoming a resercher might be a job I am cut out for.
* “I’m feeling stressed because there’s so much to do, and I don’t have enough time or skill to juggle it all productively. I don’t think I’m cut out for multitasking—I’d rather focus deeply on one specific thing. Maybe becoming a researcher would be a job I’m better suited for.”

* I have no idea what to do to create a scope of work. I need to start understanding what a scope of work document is and how it is used for. Through listening or looking at other people's document, it looks a declaration or statement what a sevice provider is about to do once the service is contracted. It sounds important to write and agree on the delivetives distinctively rather than make it umbiguous and may cause misunderstanding and argument with customer.
* I’m not quite sure how to create a scope of work document, so I need to start by understanding what it is and how it’s used. From observing others, it seems like a statement or declaration outlining what a service provider will deliver once the service is contracted. It appears essential to clearly define and agree on the deliverables to avoid any ambiguity, which could lead to misunderstandings or disagreements with the client.

* Putting hard yard is not always good strategy to keep your productivity even in the short term. I need sleep to keep productive. 120% only a day, but 60% the other day would be 70% in total. However, if you can keep 80% efficiency everyday, that would be better.
* Putting in maximum effort isn’t always the best strategy for maintaining productivity, even in the short term. I need enough sleep to stay productive. Giving 120% one day but only 60% the next averages out to about 70%. But if you can maintain 80% efficiency consistently every day, that’s actually more effective.

* I like crunchy pears, but the box of pear I bought today might be a bit softer. That's a shame. Is there any way to tell pears are crunchy or soft?
* I love crunchy pears, but the box of pears I bought today seems to be a bit softer than I prefer. What a shame. Is there any way to tell if pears are crunchy or soft before buying them?

* I drove towards country side today. It was so pleasant to drive vast wide field in this country.
* I drove out to the countryside today. It was so pleasant to drive through the vast, wide fields in this country.

* I reckon that the ability to express your ideas and opnions is the thing I need to work on most. Learning vocaburary and grammer are of course crucial, however, once you reached a platou where you don't make linear or steep progress like when you are a bigginer, you need to switch on focusing on using your language to express yourself. Knowing the gap between your mother tongue and the language you want to learn should be the measure you need to keep track on.
* I reckon that the ability to express my ideas and opinions is the area I need to work on the most. Learning vocabulary and grammar is, of course, crucial.
