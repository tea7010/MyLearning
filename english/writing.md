## My opinion

* https://japantoday.com/category/national/tokyo-trains-ask-people-to-refrain-from-wearing-halloween-costumes-that-may-scare-other-passengers
    * The company has to make an announcemnt of refraining frightenning costume on the train not to repeat the last year incidents.
    * I think this kind of announcement that prohibit wear a scared cosutume on the train wouldn't be a direct countermeasure of the incidents. I think those who are desparate people would commit a violence whatever the costume is, and wouldn't mind whether it's prohibited or not. I believe having a opportunity or advice is the most important thing to reduce such desparate violence.

So I think the govenment should consider to a law like taking the driving liscence forcely from the people who is over 80 and give some free ticket of public transportations. I might be a little unfriendly society, but I believe it would be more important to save younger people who are now supporting Japan from the fatal accidents dirived by older people.

Start from understanding the basic guitar structure and the knowledge like the strings name to move up to the next level, Until get the idea and concept of improvision of jazz, fusion and progressive genre. As he mentioned there are not so many youtube videos that explain the roadmap or comprehensive way to learn music and the guitar. I thought some recommendations of songs to practice are a bit too far since it is up to the learners to decide what songs they want to learn. However, IT appears that learning and understanding the music theory by heart with lots of experience and technical or phsical ability to play songs are essentials to get ahead on next level.
    * This video delineated the progression of guitar learning, spanning from novice to advanced levels, represented by a scale from zero to six. It commences with acquainting oneself with the fundamental structure of the guitar and understanding elements such as string names, progressing gradually to more complex concepts. Eventually, it delves into the realms of jazz, fusion, and progressive genres, elucidating the intricacies of improvisation. The presenter highlighted the scarcity of comprehensive YouTube tutorials outlining such a roadmap for music and guitar education. While they offered song recommendations for practice, it was underscored that learners have the autonomy to choose songs aligned with their preferences. However, the crux of advancement lies in mastering music theory, coupled with ample experience and the technical prowess necessary for playing diverse compositions.

    * this video delineated how to become a more efficient learner. He highlighted four points and I have already forgetting two of them, but I remember those are like, keep your brain sharp(sleep well, keep health), learn actively rather than passively, stay focused(not being buzz by smartphones), and rephrase what you learned with different words or your own expressions.
    * In the video, the presenter outlined strategies for enhancing learning efficiency. While I recall only two out of the four points, they emphasized the importance of maintaining cognitive sharpness through adequate sleep and prioritizing health. Additionally, they advocated for active engagement in the learning process, emphasizing focus over passivity and minimizing distractions such as smartphone interruptions. Another key strategy highlighted was the practice of rephrasing learned material using one's own words or expressions, reinforcing comprehension and retention.
* Blues Guitar lesson
    * This series of the videos sounds like good for me to learn basic the "soul" of blues guitar through practicing a simple lyrics. As written in the title, it is for intermediate guitar player, so it doesn't explan the fundamental things like the position of minor pentatonic scale, which I felt this video is adequate level for me. The first lecture out of 27 lessons was about the blues scale that has extra flat fifth on top of minor pentatonic. Also, quarter bending is also highlighted through practicing a riff. 
    * "This video series is perfect for me to learn the basics and the essence of blues guitar through practicing simple lyrics. As stated in the title, it is designed for intermediate guitar players, so it doesn't cover fundamental topics like the minor pentatonic scale positions, which makes it an appropriate level for me. The first lesson out of 27 focuses on the blues scale, which includes an extra flat fifth in addition to the minor pentatonic notes. It also emphasizes quarter bending while practicing a riff."
    * The part2 was about the code progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G, the forth(C) and fifth(D) are used for the code. It sounds natural and smooth or feel like surfing on the wave to change the using pentatonic scale by progression of the code. That's the same theory or typical way the same as Jazz. However, I found out that I need to work on the quick vibrart in terms of phsical practice.
    * Part 2 was about the chord progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G; the fourth (C) and fifth (D) chords are used in the progression. It sounds natural and smooth, like surfing on a wave, to change the pentatonic scale according to the chord progression. This is the same theory or typical approach used in Jazz. However, I realized that I need to work on my quick vibrato technique through physical practice.
* I saw some youtube videos about how to speak English fluently. As rule of thum, I think it is essential to learn vocaburary and common expressions through contexts, but to apply the expressions in onself's daily life or soroundings is crutial to make the learnt vocaburary active in one's mind. Speaking to oneself is a good way to try to find appropriate word to match your current situation, and make your slept vocaburary awaken.

* Today my family and me went to Costco by my wife driving. Recently, my wife practice her driving as she hadn't driven for ages since she got a driving license when she was 24 years old. In Japan, the people who don't have much experience to drive a car but spent a lot of time without driving, is called paper driver, which means that they are supposed to be able to drive, but they can't do it practically. drivers existing only on paper (I guess it used to use as managemnent of the drivers list), they are called that ironically.
* Today, my family and I went to Costco with my wife driving. Recently, she has been practicing her driving since she hadn't driven for ages after getting her license at 24. In Japan, people who have a driver's license but little actual driving experience are called "paper drivers." This term implies that they are theoretically capable of driving but can't do it practically. The name comes from the idea that their driving skills exist only on paper, originally referring to driver management lists, and is used ironically.
* We did a bbq with my frend today. Although it was just a day before I asked him to come over my house to have bbq, he visited and had a nice bbq together. I prepared some meat like Japanese style Karubi, which is thin sliced boneless short ribs, and also a sirloin steak and some vegitables. Before I came here I hadn't liked bell peppers(capsicum) so much, however, it's now one of my fevarite vegitable(fruit technically) as the good taste when we grill on charcoal. I would like to know the other vegitables and food that I don't know yet, so I would like to have more good conversation or meals with people. We will invite more people the next time.

    * QLD govenment dicided a almost free fare trial of public transportations that people can get on board buses, trains, and ferries just 50 cencts. Many people criticise this trial as to collect the votes for the next election and suspicious about the sustainability of the cheap fare in terms of the budget. Also, the premir enphasized the point of this is to get the people back to public transport as the same level as pre covid state, and to reduce the traffic when rush hours. Having said that, some people say that they choose the means of transportation by the quality of it rather than the price itself as some trials in other countries like newzealand turned out that they've got only a few increase in the number of people back to public transport.
    * The Queensland government has decided to trial almost-free fares for public transportation, allowing people to ride buses, trains, and ferries for just 50 cents. Many critics argue that this trial is a ploy to gather votes for the upcoming election and question the sustainability of such low fares given the budget constraints. Additionally, the Premier emphasized that the main goal is to encourage people to return to public transport to pre-COVID levels and to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours. However, some argue that people choose their mode of transportation based on quality rather than price. Similar trials in other countries, such as New Zealand, have shown only a slight increase in public transport usage.

* One of the most important thing when it comes to telling messages to audience is that you express your opinion with passion. Without enthsiasms, you wouldn't be able to being looked passionate to tell your message to the listeners. Talk to people with feeling even you feel like it may be exagerated.

* the complaint about the wfh display I am using is that the control buttons are pushed without touching somehow. I think it is due to some mecanically mulfunctions of circuit board or something. The odd and irritating point is that the phenomenon doesn't happen always, but sometimes. I really need to change it because it is really frustrating for me like I commerce my job, but dispalay keeps flushing or the configuration screen moving.

Recently I am really thinking to buy a thinner keyboard than the one I have now. There are two reasons why I want to swap keyboard; One is I want to keep clean and neat on my desk. The currenct mechanical keyboard is really thick and I need whlist rest board to keep my typing position and the angle of hands comfortable. To keep the desk widely and neatly by removing whist lest, I need a thinner keyboard so-called low-profile keyboard. The other reason is that I am wondering if I can use the low-profile keyboard for travel or when I work from home and want to use on laptop, so that is going to use external keyboard on laptop keyboard. Either reason, I am seeking on more portability and minimalizm.

Title: Considering a New Keyboard for a Cleaner and More Portable Setup
Lately, I've been contemplating upgrading to a thinner keyboard, and I've pinpointed two main reasons for this potential change.
Firstly, I strive to maintain a clean and neat desk. My current mechanical keyboard, while satisfying to type on, is quite thick. To maintain a comfortable typing position and angle for my hands, I need a wrist rest. The wrist rest, although useful, takes up additional space and somewhat disrupts the streamlined look I desire for my desk. By switching to a low-profile keyboard, I can eliminate the need for a wrist rest. This would help in achieving a more spacious and tidy workspace, aligning with my minimalist preferences.
Secondly, the portability factor is becoming increasingly important to me. I travel occasionally and also work from home on my laptop. Using the laptop's built-in keyboard isn’t as comfortable or efficient as I’d like. A low-profile keyboard would be lightweight and easy to carry, making it a great companion for travel. It would also provide a better typing experience when I’m working from different locations, allowing me to use an external keyboard without the bulk of my current setup.
In summary, a low-profile keyboard would not only enhance the aesthetics and functionality of my desk but also offer the portability and minimalist design that I am looking for. This would make my work setup more versatile and efficient, whether I am at home or on the go.

* I really hate to think about what to say in the meeting. Sometimes I don't have any ideas =what they are talking about and what am I suppose to say or think. I think it is because of my language skill, but other than that, I might lost interest to the topic. I am basically a bit of self satisfuction person and lose my attention when I felt it sounds boring, that making my brain stop thinking. So trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from third person's viewpoint is the key to brush up the attention to the details.
* really hate thinking about what to say in meetings. Sometimes, I have no idea what they are talking about or what I am supposed to say or think. I believe this is partly due to my language skills, but I may also lose interest in the topic. I tend to be somewhat self-satisfied and lose focus when something sounds boring, causing my mind to stop thinking. Therefore, trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from a third person's viewpoint is key to improving my attention to detail.
