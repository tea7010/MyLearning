* https://japantoday.com/category/national/tokyo-trains-ask-people-to-refrain-from-wearing-halloween-costumes-that-may-scare-other-passengers
    * The company has to make an announcemnt of refraining frightenning costume on the train not to repeat the last year incidents.
    * I think this kind of announcement that prohibit wear a scared cosutume on the train wouldn't be a direct countermeasure of the incidents. I think those who are desparate people would commit a violence whatever the costume is, and wouldn't mind whether it's prohibited or not. I believe having a opportunity or advice is the most important thing to reduce such desparate violence.

So I think the govenment should consider to a law like taking the driving liscence forcely from the people who is over 80 and give some free ticket of public transportations. I might be a little unfriendly society, but I believe it would be more important to save younger people who are now supporting Japan from the fatal accidents dirived by older people.
