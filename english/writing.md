## My opinion

* https://japantoday.com/category/national/tokyo-trains-ask-people-to-refrain-from-wearing-halloween-costumes-that-may-scare-other-passengers
    * The company has to make an announcemnt of refraining frightenning costume on the train not to repeat the last year incidents.
    * I think this kind of announcement that prohibit wear a scared cosutume on the train wouldn't be a direct countermeasure of the incidents. I think those who are desparate people would commit a violence whatever the costume is, and wouldn't mind whether it's prohibited or not. I believe having a opportunity or advice is the most important thing to reduce such desparate violence.

So I think the govenment should consider to a law like taking the driving liscence forcely from the people who is over 80 and give some free ticket of public transportations. I might be a little unfriendly society, but I believe it would be more important to save younger people who are now supporting Japan from the fatal accidents dirived by older people.

Start from understanding the basic guitar structure and the knowledge like the strings name to move up to the next level, Until get the idea and concept of improvision of jazz, fusion and progressive genre. As he mentioned there are not so many youtube videos that explain the roadmap or comprehensive way to learn music and the guitar. I thought some recommendations of songs to practice are a bit too far since it is up to the learners to decide what songs they want to learn. However, IT appears that learning and understanding the music theory by heart with lots of experience and technical or phsical ability to play songs are essentials to get ahead on next level.
    * This video delineated the progression of guitar learning, spanning from novice to advanced levels, represented by a scale from zero to six. It commences with acquainting oneself with the fundamental structure of the guitar and understanding elements such as string names, progressing gradually to more complex concepts. Eventually, it delves into the realms of jazz, fusion, and progressive genres, elucidating the intricacies of improvisation. The presenter highlighted the scarcity of comprehensive YouTube tutorials outlining such a roadmap for music and guitar education. While they offered song recommendations for practice, it was underscored that learners have the autonomy to choose songs aligned with their preferences. However, the crux of advancement lies in mastering music theory, coupled with ample experience and the technical prowess necessary for playing diverse compositions.

    * this video delineated how to become a more efficient learner. He highlighted four points and I have already forgetting two of them, but I remember those are like, keep your brain sharp(sleep well, keep health), learn actively rather than passively, stay focused(not being buzz by smartphones), and rephrase what you learned with different words or your own expressions.
    * In the video, the presenter outlined strategies for enhancing learning efficiency. While I recall only two out of the four points, they emphasized the importance of maintaining cognitive sharpness through adequate sleep and prioritizing health. Additionally, they advocated for active engagement in the learning process, emphasizing focus over passivity and minimizing distractions such as smartphone interruptions. Another key strategy highlighted was the practice of rephrasing learned material using one's own words or expressions, reinforcing comprehension and retention.
* Blues Guitar lesson
    * This series of the videos sounds like good for me to learn basic the "soul" of blues guitar through practicing a simple lyrics. As written in the title, it is for intermediate guitar player, so it doesn't explan the fundamental things like the position of minor pentatonic scale, which I felt this video is adequate level for me. The first lecture out of 27 lessons was about the blues scale that has extra flat fifth on top of minor pentatonic. Also, quarter bending is also highlighted through practicing a riff. 
    * "This video series is perfect for me to learn the basics and the essence of blues guitar through practicing simple lyrics. As stated in the title, it is designed for intermediate guitar players, so it doesn't cover fundamental topics like the minor pentatonic scale positions, which makes it an appropriate level for me. The first lesson out of 27 focuses on the blues scale, which includes an extra flat fifth in addition to the minor pentatonic notes. It also emphasizes quarter bending while practicing a riff."
    * The part2 was about the code progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G, the forth(C) and fifth(D) are used for the code. It sounds natural and smooth or feel like surfing on the wave to change the using pentatonic scale by progression of the code. That's the same theory or typical way the same as Jazz. However, I found out that I need to work on the quick vibrart in terms of phsical practice.
    * Part 2 was about the chord progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G; the fourth (C) and fifth (D) chords are used in the progression. It sounds natural and smooth, like surfing on a wave, to change the pentatonic scale according to the chord progression. This is the same theory or typical approach used in Jazz. However, I realized that I need to work on my quick vibrato technique through physical practice.
* I saw some youtube videos about how to speak English fluently. As rule of thum, I think it is essential to learn vocaburary and common expressions through contexts, but to apply the expressions in onself's daily life or soroundings is crutial to make the learnt vocaburary active in one's mind. Speaking to oneself is a good way to try to find appropriate word to match your current situation, and make your slept vocaburary awaken.

Speaking to oneself is a good way to practice finding the appropriate words to match your current situation, helping to awaken dormant vocabulary.
* Today my family and me went to Costco by my wife driving. Recently, my wife practice her driving as she hadn't driven for ages since she got a driving license when she was 24 years old. In Japan, the people who don't have much experience to drive a car but spent a lot of time without driving, is called paper driver, which means that they are supposed to be able to drive, but they can't do it practically. drivers existing only on paper (I guess it used to use as managemnent of the drivers list), they are called that ironically.
* Today, my family and I went to Costco with my wife driving. Recently, she has been practicing her driving since she hadn't driven for ages after getting her license at 24. In Japan, people who have a driver's license but little actual driving experience are called "paper drivers." This term implies that they are theoretically capable of driving but can't do it practically. The name comes from the idea that their driving skills exist only on paper, originally referring to driver management lists, and is used ironically.
* We did a bbq with my frend today. Although it was just a day before I asked him to come over my house to have bbq, he visited and had a nice bbq together. I prepared some meat like Japanese style Karubi, which is thin sliced boneless short ribs, and also a sirloin steak and some vegitables. Before I came here I hadn't liked bell peppers(capsicum) so much, however, it's now one of my fevarite vegitable(fruit technically) as the good taste when we grill on charcoal. I would like to know the other vegitables and food that I don't know yet, so I would like to have more good conversation or meals with people. We will invite more people the next time.

I prepared some meat, including Japanese-style Karubi, which is thinly sliced boneless short ribs, as well as sirloin steak and some vegetables. Before moving here, I didn't like bell peppers (capsicum) much, but now they are one of my favorite vegetables (technically fruits) because they taste so good when grilled over charcoal. I want to discover more vegetables and foods that I don't know about yet, so I look forward to having more conversations and meals with people. Next time, we will invite more friends.

    * QLD govenment dicided a almost free fare trial of public transportations that people can get on board buses, trains, and ferries just 50 cencts. Many people criticise this trial as to collect the votes for the next election and suspicious about the sustainability of the cheap fare in terms of the budget. Also, the premir enphasized the point of this is to get the people back to public transport as the same level as pre covid state, and to reduce the traffic when rush hours. Having said that, some people say that they choose the means of transportation by the quality of it rather than the price itself as some trials in other countries like newzealand turned out that they've got only a few increase in the number of people back to public transport.
    * The Queensland government has decided to trial almost-free fares for public transportation, allowing people to ride buses, trains, and ferries for just 50 cents. Many critics argue that this trial is a ploy to gather votes for the upcoming election and question the sustainability of such low fares given the budget constraints. Additionally, the Premier emphasized that the main goal is to encourage people to return to public transport to pre-COVID levels and to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours. However, some argue that people choose their mode of transportation based on quality rather than price. Similar trials in other countries, such as New Zealand, have shown only a slight increase in public transport usage.

* the complaint about the wfh display I am using is that the control buttons are pushed without touching somehow. I think it is due to some mecanically mulfunctions of circuit board or something. The odd and irritating point is that the phenomenon doesn't happen always, but sometimes. I really need to change it because it is really frustrating for me like I commerce my job, but dispalay keeps flushing or the configuration screen moving.

Recently I am really thinking to buy a thinner keyboard than the one I have now. There are two reasons why I want to swap keyboard; One is I want to keep clean and neat on my desk. The currenct mechanical keyboard is really thick and I need whlist rest board to keep my typing position and the angle of hands comfortable. To keep the desk widely and neatly by removing whist lest, I need a thinner keyboard so-called low-profile keyboard. The other reason is that I am wondering if I can use the low-profile keyboard for travel or when I work from home and want to use on laptop, so that is going to use external keyboard on laptop keyboard. Either reason, I am seeking on more portability and minimalizm.

Title: Considering a New Keyboard for a Cleaner and More Portable Setup
Lately, I've been contemplating upgrading to a thinner keyboard, and I've pinpointed two main reasons for this potential change.
Firstly, I strive to maintain a clean and neat desk. My current mechanical keyboard, while satisfying to type on, is quite thick. To maintain a comfortable typing position and angle for my hands, I need a wrist rest. The wrist rest, although useful, takes up additional space and somewhat disrupts the streamlined look I desire for my desk. By switching to a low-profile keyboard, I can eliminate the need for a wrist rest. This would help in achieving a more spacious and tidy workspace, aligning with my minimalist preferences.
Secondly, the portability factor is becoming increasingly important to me. I travel occasionally and also work from home on my laptop. Using the laptop's built-in keyboard isn’t as comfortable or efficient as I’d like. A low-profile keyboard would be lightweight and easy to carry, making it a great companion for travel. It would also provide a better typing experience when I’m working from different locations, allowing me to use an external keyboard without the bulk of my current setup.
In summary, a low-profile keyboard would not only enhance the aesthetics and functionality of my desk but also offer the portability and minimalist design that I am looking for. This would make my work setup more versatile and efficient, whether I am at home or on the go.

* I really hate to think about what to say in the meeting. Sometimes I don't have any ideas =what they are talking about and what am I suppose to say or think. I think it is because of my language skill, but other than that, I might lost interest to the topic. I am basically a bit of self satisfuction person and lose my attention when I felt it sounds boring, that making my brain stop thinking. So trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from third person's viewpoint is the key to brush up the attention to the details.
* really hate thinking about what to say in meetings. Sometimes, I have no idea what they are talking about or what I am supposed to say or think. I believe this is partly due to my language skills, but I may also lose interest in the topic. I tend to be somewhat self-satisfied and lose focus when something sounds boring, causing my mind to stop thinking. Therefore, trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from a third person's viewpoint is key to improving my attention to detail.

* I realised that I need to write and speak more and more to brush up the ability. You might afraid to remeber wrong grammer or expressions without any knowledge of them, and you stick to use the wrong expressions. It is completely wrong. Because you never notice your mistakes without trying anything. You need to try to compose sentensces with your knowledge whatever the quality is. Then you will be the first step to be aware of the area you need to work on. After several experiences you will notice that the expressions you struggled to express was something like down to the expression bra bra bra... So my message to me is just try to write down anything and speak to myself anything, and those actions are supposed to be an unconscious habit to think everything. By doing that, you will be able to a person that is storyfull and chearfull.
* I realized that I need to write and speak more to improve my English. You might be afraid of remembering incorrect grammar or expressions without knowing they are wrong, and you might end up using incorrect expressions. This is completely wrong. You will never notice your mistakes without trying. You need to try to compose sentences with your current knowledge, regardless of the quality. This is the first step to becoming aware of the areas you need to work on. After several attempts, you will notice that the expressions you struggled with become easier, and you will eventually get them right. So, my advice to myself is to just try to write and speak as much as possible. These actions should become an unconscious habit. By doing this, you will become more articulate and cheerful.

* Finnaly I bought a new keyboard, Nuphy 75, which is the version 2 model of its series. The difference between the key board that I have been using for almost 2 years and the new one is thickness. Nuphy is low-profile and it doesn't need a wrist rest on a desk. On the other hand, the one I am using now is a usual mechanical key board, which uses a chunky switch and longer travel distance in terms of pushing a switch. I wanted to bring a keyboard with my laptop and put it on the keyboard of the laptop to type and use shortcuts or key binding I want to use. I haven't gotton the percel of it yet, but I am really looking forward to using it as I even wrote about this keyboard in my diary twice.
* Finally, I bought a new keayboarad, the Nuphy 75, which is the second version of its series. The main difference between the keayboard I have been using for almost 2 years and the new one is the thickness. The nuphy is low-profile and doesn't need a wrist rest on a desk. On the other hand, the one I am using now is a typical mechanical keayboard, which uses chnky switches and has a longer travel distance when pressing a key. I wanted a keayboad that I coudl easily carry with my laptop and place over the laptop's keayboard to type and utse the shortcuts or key bindings I prefer. I haven't received the parcel yet, but I am really looking forawrd to using it, as I have evenr written about this keayboard in my diary twice.

* I watched a youtube video that a man tried to switch to a US layout keayboard from JIS layout. He pointed out one of the stambling points is the Kana/Eng switch key that is placed next to space key in JIS layout. Most of JIS users have a habit to switch JP/En mode by pressing the EN/KANA button, which might be a biggest struggle or frustlation for JIS users. However, he said the key bind control + space was fine for him and he has already been used to the key bind. The other difference between US and JIS is the size of enter key. Enter key in JIS layout is vertically long, however, the enter in US layout is one-key hight. Some people have a habit to type down enter key from backspace button when removing letters and pressing enter, which might cause a mis-input for the pople.

* I went to the post office this afternoon, and I finnaly have got a Nuphy air75 v2 which I ordered last Saturday. This is the keyboard I was looking forward to replacing Maja v2 chunky and heavy one I used for almost 2 years. The feeling of Nuphy is not so bad despite its thin body. I can feel the decent lubed mechanical switches and its sound. I am pretty satisfied this keyboard although I struggled to configure layouts using via as it needed firmware updateing using QMK tools to compatible the latest via json file. There is a web page explains how to connect to via using json file, but only a reddit post mentioned the firmware update is needed. Also, QMK tool didn't work on my windows laptop as it required admin rights to recognize and overwrite the firmware. I ended up installing the qmk tool on my mac and finnaly I was able to connect via. It was long way to make my Nuphy mykey bind, I am now happy to type with this keyboard.

* THe next thing in my bucket list especially to buy something is an amp simulator. I had a several effectors and amps to practice guitars, none of them made me keep me playing the guitar. My goal of guitar playing is just having a habit to keep practice and hopefully I would be able to play the guitar as ideal state as I imagine. So my priorities when it comes to choosing the guitar rigs are an easiness to plug and play and quality of the sound. As it is a tool to practice the guitar, it must be easy to operate core functionalities, which are tuners, rithm machine, and the sound selection. Plus, it is important for me to feel a good sound and motivate me play the guitar more. In conclusion, selecting a proper quality of product is crutial for the pople who wants to enjoy and keep the hobby life-long time, and buying on price will lose your opportunities and your money.
* The next item on my bucket list, particularly in terms of purchases, is an amp simulator. Despite having tried several effectors and amps for practicing guitar, none of them have succeeded in keeping me engaged. My goal in playing the guitar is simply to establish a consistent practice routine, with the hope of eventually reaching the level of proficiency I envision. Therefore, my primary considerations when selecting guitar equipment are ease of use and sound quality. Since it's a tool for honing my guitar skills, it needs to offer straightforward operation for essential functions such as tuning, rhythm generation, and sound selection. Additionally, it's crucial for me to experience a satisfying sound that inspires me to play more. In conclusion, choosing a high-quality product is essential for those who aim to derive lasting enjoyment from their hobby. Opting for cheaper alternatives risks missing out on opportunities and wasting money.

* I tried some AI assistent tools that help people learn a language, but I hardly come across the one that is affordable and feels good to talk. Whenever I try AI speak apps or kind of AI sparker, I feel like I am being recorded and evalated by someone, it makes me a bit awkward to talk myself hounestly. Plus, talking to myself too much details could lead a unhappy consequences if data breach happens. It is quite common to practice to talk yourself in most of English exams, like the country and town you live in, the type of accomodation, the subject you mejar in uni. Those personal infomation seems to be sabtle, but if some pople who can associate those information to other your personal informaiton, it may leads critical problem. So AI speak apps are absolutely strong tools to enhance your ability to practice your language skill, however, you need to be aware that unlike human, all things you talk may be recorded and talking too detailed information may result unwanted data breach and hacking risks.

Whenever I try AI speaking apps or similar tools, I feel like I am being recorded and evaluated by someone, which makes me feel a bit awkward. Additionally, talking to myself in too much detail could lead to unhappy consequences if a data breach occurs. It is quite common to practice speaking about personal topics in most English exams, such as the country and town you live in, the type of accommodation you have, or the subject you major in at university. These pieces of personal information might seem subtle, but if someone can connect them to other personal information, it could lead to critical problems. AI speaking apps are definitely powerful tools to enhance your language skills. However, it is important to be aware that, unlike human interactions, everything you say may be recorded. Sharing too much detailed information may result in unwanted data breaches and hacking risks.

* Today My son and I went to the zoo where we have an anual membership. The main attractions of the zoo is the touching zone where people can touch some animals like Kangaroos and donkeies etc. My son really likes the touching animals zone and he kept screaming and chasing animals. I felt it was a bit annoying and a shame for animals to be chaised, but it was really nice experience for my son to see and touch the real animals rather than seeing them in a pictture dictionary or videos. Seeing by himself eyes and touching himself are quite important to understand the world, and I think that will be a night and day differences in the long run.

* expressing and describinh the thing under your nose is significantly important. You ability of speaking and writng depends on your cognition and relations of vocabraries in your mind and netwok. Without any relation or hint your brain cna't use the vocaburary. I think those are called in-active vocaburary or passive vocaburary. You can understand the meaning when you encounter the word and expression, but you can't come up with the word when you speak and write. It is saied that increasing active vocaburary is in your mind is the key to acquire fuluency and wide range of expressions. I need to brush up the skill and that is why I am writing my thoughts here.\
* Expressing and describing the things right in front of you is significantly important. Your ability to speak and write depends on your cognition and the relationships between vocabularies in your mind and network. Without any relation or hint, your brain can’t use the vocabulary. I believe these are called inactive or passive vocabulary. You can understand the meaning when you encounter the word or expression, but you can’t come up with the word when you speak or write. It is said that increasing active vocabulary is the key to acquiring fluency and a wide range of expressions. I need to brush up on this skill, and that is why I am writing my thoughts here.

* I noticed that I am not an extravert personalty. The reason is I am feeling exhausted after we go over a friend house to have a party today. I heard that extravert people feel happy and refreshing and intravert people feel exhausting when hanging out with friends or attendting a home party. However, I don't like any ideas that dividing people binary though it is easy to imagine and explain the typical situation. I am sure all people have some portion of both extravert and intravert personality. People may feel they are extravert personality if they feel a bit of out of conversation during the party, but it is an excuse or giving up improving your ability by thinking that you are like the personality and the things could not be changed with your effort. You need to be aware of the reality of your ability and face toward the problems to figure out how to brush up the weak point of you. So I am intravert and Extravert personality in the end.

People may feel they are introverted if they feel a bit out of the conversation during a party, but thinking of it as an excuse or giving up on improving your abilities is not helpful. You need to be aware of your abilities and face your challenges to figure out how to improve your weak points. So, in the end, I am both introverted and extroverted.

* I completed reading Atomic Habits yessterday night. It was very good book for me to understand how to keep good habits and how to distruct bad habits. The book said there are four rules to keep a good habit; Make it obvious, make it easy, make it attractive, make it satisfying. I felt some of them are what exactlly I have been doing to keep and improve my skills. Wrting my effort on a markdown and commit to github is a way to keep track my study, but it also helps make it satisfying the logging by filling the github calender in green Acutually, I somehow felt pleasant by seeing the streak of green calender, and I felt the sympathy and completely agree with the idea that logging makes your study habit enjoyable and satisfyable. Probably, the most important takeaways from this book is you should't set too high goal, but achievable and lower goal and boring is the biggest stumbling block when it comes to continuing habits in the long period, and that makes the difference between the people who can master something or just scratch the surface. I need to keep good habits.

* Reading books is one of my pleasant time before go to bed, actually I read books on bed before get sleep. I have been continued this habit since 2022 when I visited Japan for the first time. The first book I really got into was Harry Potter. I coudn't stop reding it by imagining the fantastic magical world and how Harry ended up to go Hogwarts. It took almost a half year to read all the series of Harry potter, but I think those experieces give me some confident or unfear to read books or long texts in english. This morning I watched a youtube video that told how to read books fast. The point the youtuber said was that you shoudn't read a loud texts in your brain. I came into the same tips from other japanese web sites. I believe it is true and a good tip for the people who are already familier with the language a lot or mother language, however, for the people who use it as second language it is significantly further step to read book without read a loud. My brain is hard coded to read a loud in my brain, actually I feel like listening voice even when I write this dairy. I am not fluent enough to do this tip...

However, for those who use it as a second language, reading without subvocalizing is a significantly more advanced step. My brain is hardwired to read aloud in my mind; in fact, I feel like I am listening to a voice even as I write this diary. I am not fluent enough to use this tip yet...

* Aftter started to write diary everyday, I feel I am now able to speak more fuluently than before. Especially, I became I can speak about my feelings and opinions without hesitation. Of course sometimes I fail to make the point straght and construct sentenses without any mistakes, I would say I am not like butterfilies in my stomach or pulling the trigger to say trivial things. I think this is thanks to the habits of writing anything everyday and learning vocaburaries with some books. I need to maintain these habits not to get boring.
* After starting to write a diary every day, I feel I am now able to speak more fluently than before. Especially, I can now express my feelings and opinions without hesitation. Of course, sometimes I fail to make my point clearly and construct sentences without any mistakes, but I would say I no longer have butterflies in my stomach or feel like I'm pulling the trigger to say trivial things. I think this improvement is thanks to the habit of writing every day and learning new vocabulary from some books. I need to maintain these habits to keep from getting bored.

* when it comes to traveling, sometimes I don't have time to plan the activity and places beforehand, but somehow I feel it is more enjoyable not to preparing the plan than when preparing a lot. It might be due to the fact that your plan wouldn't go as planned always, because of a lot of undecided factors like weather conditions, your and your family mental and phsical condiotns, and estimation of time.

So it is awkward for the people who has just started to write a diary recently, but it will change you little by little.
