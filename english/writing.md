## My opinion

* https://japantoday.com/category/national/tokyo-trains-ask-people-to-refrain-from-wearing-halloween-costumes-that-may-scare-other-passengers
    * The company has to make an announcemnt of refraining frightenning costume on the train not to repeat the last year incidents.
    * I think this kind of announcement that prohibit wear a scared cosutume on the train wouldn't be a direct countermeasure of the incidents. I think those who are desparate people would commit a violence whatever the costume is, and wouldn't mind whether it's prohibited or not. I believe having a opportunity or advice is the most important thing to reduce such desparate violence.

So I think the govenment should consider to a law like taking the driving liscence forcely from the people who is over 80 and give some free ticket of public transportations. I might be a little unfriendly society, but I believe it would be more important to save younger people who are now supporting Japan from the fatal accidents dirived by older people.

Start from understanding the basic guitar structure and the knowledge like the strings name to move up to the next level, Until get the idea and concept of improvision of jazz, fusion and progressive genre. As he mentioned there are not so many youtube videos that explain the roadmap or comprehensive way to learn music and the guitar. I thought some recommendations of songs to practice are a bit too far since it is up to the learners to decide what songs they want to learn. However, IT appears that learning and understanding the music theory by heart with lots of experience and technical or phsical ability to play songs are essentials to get ahead on next level.
    * This video delineated the progression of guitar learning, spanning from novice to advanced levels, represented by a scale from zero to six. It commences with acquainting oneself with the fundamental structure of the guitar and understanding elements such as string names, progressing gradually to more complex concepts. Eventually, it delves into the realms of jazz, fusion, and progressive genres, elucidating the intricacies of improvisation. The presenter highlighted the scarcity of comprehensive YouTube tutorials outlining such a roadmap for music and guitar education. While they offered song recommendations for practice, it was underscored that learners have the autonomy to choose songs aligned with their preferences. However, the crux of advancement lies in mastering music theory, coupled with ample experience and the technical prowess necessary for playing diverse compositions.

    * this video delineated how to become a more efficient learner. He highlighted four points and I have already forgetting two of them, but I remember those are like, keep your brain sharp(sleep well, keep health), learn actively rather than passively, stay focused(not being buzz by smartphones), and rephrase what you learned with different words or your own expressions.
    * In the video, the presenter outlined strategies for enhancing learning efficiency. While I recall only two out of the four points, they emphasized the importance of maintaining cognitive sharpness through adequate sleep and prioritizing health. Additionally, they advocated for active engagement in the learning process, emphasizing focus over passivity and minimizing distractions such as smartphone interruptions. Another key strategy highlighted was the practice of rephrasing learned material using one's own words or expressions, reinforcing comprehension and retention.
* Blues Guitar lesson
    * This series of the videos sounds like good for me to learn basic the "soul" of blues guitar through practicing a simple lyrics. As written in the title, it is for intermediate guitar player, so it doesn't explan the fundamental things like the position of minor pentatonic scale, which I felt this video is adequate level for me. The first lecture out of 27 lessons was about the blues scale that has extra flat fifth on top of minor pentatonic. Also, quarter bending is also highlighted through practicing a riff. 
    * "This video series is perfect for me to learn the basics and the essence of blues guitar through practicing simple lyrics. As stated in the title, it is designed for intermediate guitar players, so it doesn't cover fundamental topics like the minor pentatonic scale positions, which makes it an appropriate level for me. The first lesson out of 27 focuses on the blues scale, which includes an extra flat fifth in addition to the minor pentatonic notes. It also emphasizes quarter bending while practicing a riff."
    * The part2 was about the code progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G, the forth(C) and fifth(D) are used for the code. It sounds natural and smooth or feel like surfing on the wave to change the using pentatonic scale by progression of the code. That's the same theory or typical way the same as Jazz. However, I found out that I need to work on the quick vibrart in terms of phsical practice.
    * Part 2 was about the chord progression of the basic blues. Let's say the root is G; the fourth (C) and fifth (D) chords are used in the progression. It sounds natural and smooth, like surfing on a wave, to change the pentatonic scale according to the chord progression. This is the same theory or typical approach used in Jazz. However, I realized that I need to work on my quick vibrato technique through physical practice.
* I saw some youtube videos about how to speak English fluently. As rule of thum, I think it is essential to learn vocaburary and common expressions through contexts, but to apply the expressions in onself's daily life or soroundings is crutial to make the learnt vocaburary active in one's mind. Speaking to oneself is a good way to try to find appropriate word to match your current situation, and make your slept vocaburary awaken.

Speaking to oneself is a good way to practice finding the appropriate words to match your current situation, helping to awaken dormant vocabulary.
* Today my family and me went to Costco by my wife driving. Recently, my wife practice her driving as she hadn't driven for ages since she got a driving license when she was 24 years old. In Japan, the people who don't have much experience to drive a car but spent a lot of time without driving, is called paper driver, which means that they are supposed to be able to drive, but they can't do it practically. drivers existing only on paper (I guess it used to use as managemnent of the drivers list), they are called that ironically.
* Today, my family and I went to Costco with my wife driving. Recently, she has been practicing her driving since she hadn't driven for ages after getting her license at 24. In Japan, people who have a driver's license but little actual driving experience are called "paper drivers." This term implies that they are theoretically capable of driving but can't do it practically. The name comes from the idea that their driving skills exist only on paper, originally referring to driver management lists, and is used ironically.
* We did a bbq with my frend today. Although it was just a day before I asked him to come over my house to have bbq, he visited and had a nice bbq together. I prepared some meat like Japanese style Karubi, which is thin sliced boneless short ribs, and also a sirloin steak and some vegitables. Before I came here I hadn't liked bell peppers(capsicum) so much, however, it's now one of my fevarite vegitable(fruit technically) as the good taste when we grill on charcoal. I would like to know the other vegitables and food that I don't know yet, so I would like to have more good conversation or meals with people. We will invite more people the next time.

I prepared some meat, including Japanese-style Karubi, which is thinly sliced boneless short ribs, as well as sirloin steak and some vegetables. Before moving here, I didn't like bell peppers (capsicum) much, but now they are one of my favorite vegetables (technically fruits) because they taste so good when grilled over charcoal. I want to discover more vegetables and foods that I don't know about yet, so I look forward to having more conversations and meals with people. Next time, we will invite more friends.

    * QLD govenment dicided a almost free fare trial of public transportations that people can get on board buses, trains, and ferries just 50 cencts. Many people criticise this trial as to collect the votes for the next election and suspicious about the sustainability of the cheap fare in terms of the budget. Also, the premir enphasized the point of this is to get the people back to public transport as the same level as pre covid state, and to reduce the traffic when rush hours. Having said that, some people say that they choose the means of transportation by the quality of it rather than the price itself as some trials in other countries like newzealand turned out that they've got only a few increase in the number of people back to public transport.
    * The Queensland government has decided to trial almost-free fares for public transportation, allowing people to ride buses, trains, and ferries for just 50 cents. Many critics argue that this trial is a ploy to gather votes for the upcoming election and question the sustainability of such low fares given the budget constraints. Additionally, the Premier emphasized that the main goal is to encourage people to return to public transport to pre-COVID levels and to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours. However, some argue that people choose their mode of transportation based on quality rather than price. Similar trials in other countries, such as New Zealand, have shown only a slight increase in public transport usage.

* the complaint about the wfh display I am using is that the control buttons are pushed without touching somehow. I think it is due to some mecanically mulfunctions of circuit board or something. The odd and irritating point is that the phenomenon doesn't happen always, but sometimes. I really need to change it because it is really frustrating for me like I commerce my job, but dispalay keeps flushing or the configuration screen moving.

Recently I am really thinking to buy a thinner keyboard than the one I have now. There are two reasons why I want to swap keyboard; One is I want to keep clean and neat on my desk. The currenct mechanical keyboard is really thick and I need whlist rest board to keep my typing position and the angle of hands comfortable. To keep the desk widely and neatly by removing whist lest, I need a thinner keyboard so-called low-profile keyboard. The other reason is that I am wondering if I can use the low-profile keyboard for travel or when I work from home and want to use on laptop, so that is going to use external keyboard on laptop keyboard. Either reason, I am seeking on more portability and minimalizm.

Title: Considering a New Keyboard for a Cleaner and More Portable Setup
Lately, I've been contemplating upgrading to a thinner keyboard, and I've pinpointed two main reasons for this potential change.
Firstly, I strive to maintain a clean and neat desk. My current mechanical keyboard, while satisfying to type on, is quite thick. To maintain a comfortable typing position and angle for my hands, I need a wrist rest. The wrist rest, although useful, takes up additional space and somewhat disrupts the streamlined look I desire for my desk. By switching to a low-profile keyboard, I can eliminate the need for a wrist rest. This would help in achieving a more spacious and tidy workspace, aligning with my minimalist preferences.
Secondly, the portability factor is becoming increasingly important to me. I travel occasionally and also work from home on my laptop. Using the laptop's built-in keyboard isn’t as comfortable or efficient as I’d like. A low-profile keyboard would be lightweight and easy to carry, making it a great companion for travel. It would also provide a better typing experience when I’m working from different locations, allowing me to use an external keyboard without the bulk of my current setup.
In summary, a low-profile keyboard would not only enhance the aesthetics and functionality of my desk but also offer the portability and minimalist design that I am looking for. This would make my work setup more versatile and efficient, whether I am at home or on the go.

* I really hate to think about what to say in the meeting. Sometimes I don't have any ideas =what they are talking about and what am I suppose to say or think. I think it is because of my language skill, but other than that, I might lost interest to the topic. I am basically a bit of self satisfuction person and lose my attention when I felt it sounds boring, that making my brain stop thinking. So trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from third person's viewpoint is the key to brush up the attention to the details.
* really hate thinking about what to say in meetings. Sometimes, I have no idea what they are talking about or what I am supposed to say or think. I believe this is partly due to my language skills, but I may also lose interest in the topic. I tend to be somewhat self-satisfied and lose focus when something sounds boring, causing my mind to stop thinking. Therefore, trying to describe the situation and capture what is going on from a third person's viewpoint is key to improving my attention to detail.

* I realised that I need to write and speak more and more to brush up the ability. You might afraid to remeber wrong grammer or expressions without any knowledge of them, and you stick to use the wrong expressions. It is completely wrong. Because you never notice your mistakes without trying anything. You need to try to compose sentensces with your knowledge whatever the quality is. Then you will be the first step to be aware of the area you need to work on. After several experiences you will notice that the expressions you struggled to express was something like down to the expression bra bra bra... So my message to me is just try to write down anything and speak to myself anything, and those actions are supposed to be an unconscious habit to think everything. By doing that, you will be able to a person that is storyfull and chearfull.
* I realized that I need to write and speak more to improve my English. You might be afraid of remembering incorrect grammar or expressions without knowing they are wrong, and you might end up using incorrect expressions. This is completely wrong. You will never notice your mistakes without trying. You need to try to compose sentences with your current knowledge, regardless of the quality. This is the first step to becoming aware of the areas you need to work on. After several attempts, you will notice that the expressions you struggled with become easier, and you will eventually get them right. So, my advice to myself is to just try to write and speak as much as possible. These actions should become an unconscious habit. By doing this, you will become more articulate and cheerful.

* Finnaly I bought a new keyboard, Nuphy 75, which is the version 2 model of its series. The difference between the key board that I have been using for almost 2 years and the new one is thickness. Nuphy is low-profile and it doesn't need a wrist rest on a desk. On the other hand, the one I am using now is a usual mechanical key board, which uses a chunky switch and longer travel distance in terms of pushing a switch. I wanted to bring a keyboard with my laptop and put it on the keyboard of the laptop to type and use shortcuts or key binding I want to use. I haven't gotton the percel of it yet, but I am really looking forward to using it as I even wrote about this keyboard in my diary twice.
* Finally, I bought a new keayboarad, the Nuphy 75, which is the second version of its series. The main difference between the keayboard I have been using for almost 2 years and the new one is the thickness. The nuphy is low-profile and doesn't need a wrist rest on a desk. On the other hand, the one I am using now is a typical mechanical keayboard, which uses chnky switches and has a longer travel distance when pressing a key. I wanted a keayboad that I coudl easily carry with my laptop and place over the laptop's keayboard to type and utse the shortcuts or key bindings I prefer. I haven't received the parcel yet, but I am really looking forawrd to using it, as I have evenr written about this keayboard in my diary twice.

* I watched a youtube video that a man tried to switch to a US layout keayboard from JIS layout. He pointed out one of the stambling points is the Kana/Eng switch key that is placed next to space key in JIS layout. Most of JIS users have a habit to switch JP/En mode by pressing the EN/KANA button, which might be a biggest struggle or frustlation for JIS users. However, he said the key bind control + space was fine for him and he has already been used to the key bind. The other difference between US and JIS is the size of enter key. Enter key in JIS layout is vertically long, however, the enter in US layout is one-key hight. Some people have a habit to type down enter key from backspace button when removing letters and pressing enter, which might cause a mis-input for the pople.

* I went to the post office this afternoon, and I finnaly have got a Nuphy air75 v2 which I ordered last Saturday. This is the keyboard I was looking forward to replacing Maja v2 chunky and heavy one I used for almost 2 years. The feeling of Nuphy is not so bad despite its thin body. I can feel the decent lubed mechanical switches and its sound. I am pretty satisfied this keyboard although I struggled to configure layouts using via as it needed firmware updateing using QMK tools to compatible the latest via json file. There is a web page explains how to connect to via using json file, but only a reddit post mentioned the firmware update is needed. Also, QMK tool didn't work on my windows laptop as it required admin rights to recognize and overwrite the firmware. I ended up installing the qmk tool on my mac and finnaly I was able to connect via. It was long way to make my Nuphy mykey bind, I am now happy to type with this keyboard.

* THe next thing in my bucket list especially to buy something is an amp simulator. I had a several effectors and amps to practice guitars, none of them made me keep me playing the guitar. My goal of guitar playing is just having a habit to keep practice and hopefully I would be able to play the guitar as ideal state as I imagine. So my priorities when it comes to choosing the guitar rigs are an easiness to plug and play and quality of the sound. As it is a tool to practice the guitar, it must be easy to operate core functionalities, which are tuners, rithm machine, and the sound selection. Plus, it is important for me to feel a good sound and motivate me play the guitar more. In conclusion, selecting a proper quality of product is crutial for the pople who wants to enjoy and keep the hobby life-long time, and buying on price will lose your opportunities and your money.
* The next item on my bucket list, particularly in terms of purchases, is an amp simulator. Despite having tried several effectors and amps for practicing guitar, none of them have succeeded in keeping me engaged. My goal in playing the guitar is simply to establish a consistent practice routine, with the hope of eventually reaching the level of proficiency I envision. Therefore, my primary considerations when selecting guitar equipment are ease of use and sound quality. Since it's a tool for honing my guitar skills, it needs to offer straightforward operation for essential functions such as tuning, rhythm generation, and sound selection. Additionally, it's crucial for me to experience a satisfying sound that inspires me to play more. In conclusion, choosing a high-quality product is essential for those who aim to derive lasting enjoyment from their hobby. Opting for cheaper alternatives risks missing out on opportunities and wasting money.

* I tried some AI assistent tools that help people learn a language, but I hardly come across the one that is affordable and feels good to talk. Whenever I try AI speak apps or kind of AI sparker, I feel like I am being recorded and evalated by someone, it makes me a bit awkward to talk myself hounestly. Plus, talking to myself too much details could lead a unhappy consequences if data breach happens. It is quite common to practice to talk yourself in most of English exams, like the country and town you live in, the type of accomodation, the subject you mejar in uni. Those personal infomation seems to be sabtle, but if some pople who can associate those information to other your personal informaiton, it may leads critical problem. So AI speak apps are absolutely strong tools to enhance your ability to practice your language skill, however, you need to be aware that unlike human, all things you talk may be recorded and talking too detailed information may result unwanted data breach and hacking risks.

Whenever I try AI speaking apps or similar tools, I feel like I am being recorded and evaluated by someone, which makes me feel a bit awkward. Additionally, talking to myself in too much detail could lead to unhappy consequences if a data breach occurs. It is quite common to practice speaking about personal topics in most English exams, such as the country and town you live in, the type of accommodation you have, or the subject you major in at university. These pieces of personal information might seem subtle, but if someone can connect them to other personal information, it could lead to critical problems. AI speaking apps are definitely powerful tools to enhance your language skills. However, it is important to be aware that, unlike human interactions, everything you say may be recorded. Sharing too much detailed information may result in unwanted data breaches and hacking risks.

* Today My son and I went to the zoo where we have an anual membership. The main attractions of the zoo is the touching zone where people can touch some animals like Kangaroos and donkeies etc. My son really likes the touching animals zone and he kept screaming and chasing animals. I felt it was a bit annoying and a shame for animals to be chaised, but it was really nice experience for my son to see and touch the real animals rather than seeing them in a pictture dictionary or videos. Seeing by himself eyes and touching himself are quite important to understand the world, and I think that will be a night and day differences in the long run.

* expressing and describinh the thing under your nose is significantly important. You ability of speaking and writng depends on your cognition and relations of vocabraries in your mind and netwok. Without any relation or hint your brain cna't use the vocaburary. I think those are called in-active vocaburary or passive vocaburary. You can understand the meaning when you encounter the word and expression, but you can't come up with the word when you speak and write. It is saied that increasing active vocaburary is in your mind is the key to acquire fuluency and wide range of expressions. I need to brush up the skill and that is why I am writing my thoughts here.\
* Expressing and describing the things right in front of you is significantly important. Your ability to speak and write depends on your cognition and the relationships between vocabularies in your mind and network. Without any relation or hint, your brain can’t use the vocabulary. I believe these are called inactive or passive vocabulary. You can understand the meaning when you encounter the word or expression, but you can’t come up with the word when you speak or write. It is said that increasing active vocabulary is the key to acquiring fluency and a wide range of expressions. I need to brush up on this skill, and that is why I am writing my thoughts here.

* I noticed that I am not an extravert personalty. The reason is I am feeling exhausted after we go over a friend house to have a party today. I heard that extravert people feel happy and refreshing and intravert people feel exhausting when hanging out with friends or attendting a home party. However, I don't like any ideas that dividing people binary though it is easy to imagine and explain the typical situation. I am sure all people have some portion of both extravert and intravert personality. People may feel they are extravert personality if they feel a bit of out of conversation during the party, but it is an excuse or giving up improving your ability by thinking that you are like the personality and the things could not be changed with your effort. You need to be aware of the reality of your ability and face toward the problems to figure out how to brush up the weak point of you. So I am intravert and Extravert personality in the end.

People may feel they are introverted if they feel a bit out of the conversation during a party, but thinking of it as an excuse or giving up on improving your abilities is not helpful. You need to be aware of your abilities and face your challenges to figure out how to improve your weak points. So, in the end, I am both introverted and extroverted.

* I completed reading Atomic Habits yessterday night. It was very good book for me to understand how to keep good habits and how to distruct bad habits. The book said there are four rules to keep a good habit; Make it obvious, make it easy, make it attractive, make it satisfying. I felt some of them are what exactlly I have been doing to keep and improve my skills. Wrting my effort on a markdown and commit to github is a way to keep track my study, but it also helps make it satisfying the logging by filling the github calender in green Acutually, I somehow felt pleasant by seeing the streak of green calender, and I felt the sympathy and completely agree with the idea that logging makes your study habit enjoyable and satisfyable. Probably, the most important takeaways from this book is you should't set too high goal, but achievable and lower goal and boring is the biggest stumbling block when it comes to continuing habits in the long period, and that makes the difference between the people who can master something or just scratch the surface. I need to keep good habits.

* Reading books is one of my pleasant time before go to bed, actually I read books on bed before get sleep. I have been continued this habit since 2022 when I visited Japan for the first time. The first book I really got into was Harry Potter. I coudn't stop reding it by imagining the fantastic magical world and how Harry ended up to go Hogwarts. It took almost a half year to read all the series of Harry potter, but I think those experieces give me some confident or unfear to read books or long texts in english. This morning I watched a youtube video that told how to read books fast. The point the youtuber said was that you shoudn't read a loud texts in your brain. I came into the same tips from other japanese web sites. I believe it is true and a good tip for the people who are already familier with the language a lot or mother language, however, for the people who use it as second language it is significantly further step to read book without read a loud. My brain is hard coded to read a loud in my brain, actually I feel like listening voice even when I write this dairy. I am not fluent enough to do this tip...

However, for those who use it as a second language, reading without subvocalizing is a significantly more advanced step. My brain is hardwired to read aloud in my mind; in fact, I feel like I am listening to a voice even as I write this diary. I am not fluent enough to use this tip yet...

* Aftter started to write diary everyday, I feel I am now able to speak more fuluently than before. Especially, I became I can speak about my feelings and opinions without hesitation. Of course sometimes I fail to make the point straght and construct sentenses without any mistakes, I would say I am not like butterfilies in my stomach or pulling the trigger to say trivial things. I think this is thanks to the habits of writing anything everyday and learning vocaburaries with some books. I need to maintain these habits not to get boring.
* After starting to write a diary every day, I feel I am now able to speak more fluently than before. Especially, I can now express my feelings and opinions without hesitation. Of course, sometimes I fail to make my point clearly and construct sentences without any mistakes, but I would say I no longer have butterflies in my stomach or feel like I'm pulling the trigger to say trivial things. I think this improvement is thanks to the habit of writing every day and learning new vocabulary from some books. I need to maintain these habits to keep from getting bored.

* when it comes to traveling, sometimes I don't have time to plan the activity and places beforehand, but somehow I feel it is more enjoyable not to preparing the plan than when preparing a lot. It might be due to the fact that your plan wouldn't go as planned always, because of a lot of undecided factors like weather conditions, your and your family mental and phsical condiotns, and estimation of time. It is impossible to make a perfect plan and execute them without any differences, and the more dense your plan becomes, the mroe gap and stress you will experience. I think this is the reason why you feel going to travel on the fly is more enjoyable.
* laces beforehand. However, I find it more enjoyable to travel without a detailed plan. This might be because plans often don't go as expected due to various unpredictable factors like weather conditions, the mental and physical states of you and your family, and time estimations. It's impossible to create and execute a perfect plan without any deviations. The more detailed your plan is, the more gaps and stress you might experience. This is why I believe traveling spontaneously is more enjoyable.

* I've been to a popular sightseeing spot today. It was spectaclar scenery that tremendaous green forests speading until horizon line and iconic hill standing majestically. I didin't know that, but I have heard that it is a world heiritage site. It was pretty easy access from the center of the city by driving and even the train is also available to go there. I thought this place is the must-go place when you visit this country.

* This time I took three days off for visiting other place in this country to praise myself for keeping good habits. I feel like refreshed completely by seeing great nature scenery that I had never imagined and nice authentic chinese foods. When I travel I dodn't usually expect foods in locals, but the food in the state was amazing, especially chinese food. I heard lots of chinese people migrated in the area and it makes sense that there are lots of authentic chinese restaurant in there. Especially I really liked the dumplings and noodles that I heard they are from northen part of china. Noodles was different to Japanese ramen in terms of the base of bross soup and noodles themselves. The chinese noodles is more like smooth and soft as if Udon in Japan. either way, I really impressed the chinese food in the state even though it is not in china.
* This time, I took three days off to visit another part of the country as a reward for maintaining good habits. I felt completely refreshed by the breathtaking natural scenery I had never imagined and the delicious, authentic Chinese food. When I travel, I usually don't have high expectations for local cuisine, but the food in this region was amazing, especially the Chinese food. I heard that many Chinese people have migrated to the area, which explains the abundance of authentic Chinese restaurants. I particularly enjoyed the dumplings and noodles, which I learned are from the northern part of China. The noodles were different from Japanese ramen, both in the broth base and the noodles themselves. The Chinese noodles were smooth and soft, similar to Udon in Japan. Overall, I was very impressed with the Chinese food in the area, even though it's not in China.

* I think stress in work could affects the private life. Especially if you find something like you thought it was true but it was mistake, you would feel like you were put on the courner. However, most of work could be wrong and even nobody notice it is wrong. I think you are lucky to find your mistakes and can ake the experience better understanding of the thing and behind the scene more. I believe this can help you be more professional and experienced.
* I think stress at work can affect your personal life. Especially if you discover something you believed to be true was actually a mistake, it can make you feel cornered. However, many mistakes at work go unnoticed. I believe you're lucky to find your mistakes because it gives you a chance to learn and gain a deeper understanding of the situation. This can help you become more professional and experienced.

* Writing your feelings and opinions is a good habit and strategy to keep your mind clear. It is my experience when I was a grad and started working in a company, but I was not able to organize my ideas well even in my mother tongue and felt a lot of stress and pressure that most of them were out of my control or difficult to address. If your concerning thing is related to lack of your skill and have enough time to address it, it is a chance to brush up your possibility to grow. However, there are so many things that you are out of your reach and even you are not supposed to see it, Ingnoring is bliss. So what I learnt from my experience is; Writing the things you concerns into just a bullet points and sorting out each point whether those are in your responsibility or out of your control or things you want to do. the tip make you feel better.
* Writing down your feelings and opinions is a good habit and an effective strategy to keep your mind clear. When I was a graduate and started working at a company, I struggled to organize my ideas, even in my native language. This caused me a lot of stress and pressure, much of which was beyond my control or difficult to address. If your concerns are related to a lack of skills and you have enough time to address them, it's an opportunity to grow. However, many things are beyond your control and not your responsibility. In such cases, ignoring them can be a blessing. From my experience, I learned that writing down your concerns as bullet points and sorting each point into categories—whether they are within your responsibility, out of your control, or things you want to do—can make you feel better.

* Even though it past several month since I bought a BBQ grill, I still need practicing to grill a steak. I think I did typical and gold standard preparation for steak today, like putting a frozen steak meat a day before we eat, seasoning with generous amount of sult and pappers and grilling with lid for about 4mins each side and resting in foils about 3mins. Despite the way to cook, the state of the steak was not the one I expected. I expected midium-rare, but it was almost a rare. I don't know which step was wrong today, but the biggest mistake I did today was I didn't use theormometer to guage the temprature of the center of the meat. Quantifying the quality of baking is crucial process when it comes to making a good meal.
* Even though several months have passed since I bought a BBQ grill, I still need practice grilling steak. Today, I thought I followed the typical and gold standard preparation for steak: thawing a frozen steak a day before cooking, generously seasoning with salt and pepper, grilling with the lid on for about 4 minutes on each side, and resting it in foil for about 3 minutes. Despite following these steps, the steak didn't turn out as expected. I was aiming for medium-rare, but it ended up almost rare. I'm not sure which step went wrong today, but the biggest mistake was not using a thermometer to gauge the temperature at the center of the meat. Accurately measuring the doneness is crucial when aiming to prepare a good meal.

 * I am writing this on a bed today. I usually write a diary on a desk in another bedroom, but I felt like I wanted to change the taste today. It may help me feel fresh and keep the habit to write my opinion on my own words to brush up English and language ability itself. I believe there are some people who can improve their language skill through just talking to people, but I am not like the person. I need to consider carefully the word and what I am going to say and write a bit of time, and that pause is usually too long when talking to people. I don't know this is on the right track when acquiring fluency, but writing gives me plenty time to organize the idea what I am feeling and choose the correct and closest word that can express what I am thinking. So it is awkward for the people who has just started to write a diary recently, but it will change you little by little. 
 * I am writing this in bed today. I usually write my diary at a desk in another bedroom, but I felt like changing things up today. This change may help me feel refreshed and maintain the habit of writing my thoughts in my own words to improve my English and overall language skills. I believe some people can improve their language skills just by talking to others, but I am not one of those people. I need to carefully consider the words I use and what I want to say, and that pause is usually too long when speaking to others. I don't know if this is the right approach to acquiring fluency, but writing gives me plenty of time to organize my thoughts and choose the correct and closest words to express what I am thinking. It might feel awkward for people who have just started keeping a diary, but it will change you little by little.

 * I have been flustrated this monitor I have used since I got it from the company for working from home. The reason is that the setting of the monitor moves without touching. Crossing mark or maginifying area for FPS games shows every 10 mins and it drives me nuts. I need to talk to the person who is in IT department to replace this monitor to new one. Otherwise, I might destroy the monitor with furry someday.
 * I have been frustrated with this monitor since I got it from the company for working from home. The problem is that the settings on the monitor change without me touching it. A crosshair or magnifying area for FPS games appears every 10 minutes, and it drives me nuts. I need to talk to someone in the IT department to replace this monitor with a new one. Otherwise, I might destroy it in a fit of rage someday.

 * I am getting used to write a diary at end of day, but I am also getting feel bored to it. For the first week, I had completely no ideas to write and what to start. However, I can now express my opinion more clearly and quicker. Also, the habit made me a bit confident even at work. I used to use chatgpt or so on almost my reply to chat, and took very long time to review a reply and revise with AI. However, now I can reply immediately and I feel Telling and considering what you are thinking and feeling is much more important than revising the grammer or words of it. People want you to give them your opinion, not a nice wrote english sentenses but no content. Your opinion or content is 100 times worth. Therefore, I will maintain this writing habit mainly focusing on output and substance my feelings and thinking into written something.

 * I am on two minds whether to buy a Xreal Air 2 pro, which is AR glassess manily focused on providing immersed monitor. Unlike other AR/VR glasses such as Apple vision pro, it doesn't have fancy functionality like recognizing your fingers and using the motions to contole the divice. However, the Xreal device focused on providing the virtual monitor environment, which would be the most useful thing for 99% people when it comes to utilizing AR/VR. Of-course they can enhance its virtual reality by combining fancy technologies that Meta and Apple are doing, but I think such functionalities are just being showed off by those companies, and won't give us really useful tool that we use everyday work/studying. Xreal is cut down such nice-to-have and bells and whistles of AR/VR grasses and give us just "needed" tool, that is why I would like to get my hands on it and try.
 * I am torn between whether to buy the Xreal Air 2 Pro, AR glasses primarily focused on providing an immersive monitor experience. Unlike other AR/VR glasses like Apple's Vision Pro, it lacks advanced functionalities such as finger recognition and motion control. However, the Xreal device prioritizes creating a virtual monitor environment, which is likely the most practical feature for 99% of users interested in AR/VR. While companies like Meta and Apple enhance their products with flashy technologies, I believe such features are more about showcasing than providing genuinely useful tools for everyday work or studying. Xreal strips away these extras from AR/VR glasses and offers a focused, essential tool. That's why I'm eager to try it out.

 * Using chatGPT to practice writing english is really convenient for me. Unlike human based service like online english service, you don't have to spare chunk of time like 30min, and you can do whenever you want. What you have to do is just asking ChatGPTS to have a chat with you with a specific topic you want to talk. I have never tried yet, but the latest model can do a kind of near realtime conversation, and it enable you practice talking as if you talk to somebody. I think this is one of the most correct way to use AI. I hope many people stop using AI in a wrong way, but use the splendid technology more good way to enhance human ability.

 * I have been getting weight since I started pumping irons because I need a lot of proteins and carbo to get mascle. However, it seems like getting mascle without getting any fat is impossible according to some youtube videos I watched. It means I need to lose my fat at some point, otherwise I am going to be a fat man with lots of mascles. I need find a way to lose fat as small loss mascle as possible. One thing I have seen was walking everymorning before brakfast. It said that doing a modarate excercising in the starving condition makes your body use and burn your fat as energy and eventually lose your weight. it makes sense. I need to start walking everymorning, but I am just a too lazy not to be able to get up early in the morning. I need to work on that...
 * gain weight

 * as little mascle loss as possible

 * My means of commute depends on days. On Monday, I drive my car and drop my kids off at childcare and park at the office. On Tuesday and Wednesday, I don't ususlly use the car, but I take ferry. Taking a bus is the fastest way to get to the office, but I like feeling breeze on ferry and relax on the seat. THe ferry is also less packed compared to other public transport, so I can be productive on a ferry, like considering the texts of email, writing documents, watching a youtube video, and so on and forth. On Thursday, I drive the car the same as on Monday. I really hate driving in rush hours. It takes almost an hour to get to my place as it takes only 15mins in non rush hours. Nothing boring and non-productive time than driving in traffic. That is why I use public transportation and pay fees on Tuesday and Wednesday rather than driving in traffic and taking risks for accidents. On Friday, it's half and half to go to the office by car or work from home. it's up to my mood and family situation.

* I have been practicing blues guitar because the blues music is cool, it's also cool to improvise music and it is calm compared to other music genre for youth like metal, punk, phyche and so on. I tried Jazz music several years ago, but I ended up holding up learning it then, as I don't listen to Jazz so often and its scales of notes were too complicated. Holding up learning jazz doesn't mean I gave up, but just suspended for now and I am keen to learn Jazz in the future. Blues is basically more simple when it comes to the scales, Blues uses mainly minor and major pentatonic scales with blue note. That's very simple, but there are lots of songs created by the simple scale over past 70years. I think most people don't like the complexity and tend to like music simple enough that can sing the melody with voice. I think that's the reason blues is loved by many people for long time.
* I've been practicing blues guitar because I find blues music cool. It's enjoyable to improvise and it has a calming vibe compared to other genres popular among youth, like metal, punk, and psychedelic music. A few years ago, I tried getting into jazz, but I ended up pausing my learning journey because I don't listen to jazz frequently and its scales are quite complex. Pausing my jazz studies doesn't mean I've given up on it; I plan to revisit learning jazz in the future. Blues music is simpler in terms of scales. It mainly uses minor and major pentatonic scales along with the blues note. Despite its simplicity, blues has produced countless songs over the past 70 years. I believe many people prefer music that is simpler and allows them to sing along with the melody. This simplicity may explain why blues has been loved by so many people for such a long time."

* I bought a Spark Go, which is a new guitar gear for me. The reason I bought this is becasuse the headphone amp I was using to practice guitar has been making noise when I connect it to the guitar. I thought the headphone amp has broken, but the truth was different. When I connected the new arrived amp with the guitar, it didn't make any sound. The guitar has been something wrong and causing noise when connected to the headphone amp. It is a typical mistake of troubleshooting. You didn't see right under your nose and consider the other possbilities. So the next thing I need to do to enjoy my guitar life is, maybe buying a new guitar or fix the guitar somehow.

* I wonder how people come across and learn new vocaburaly. I have been using dictionary book that shows selected words and expressions and published in Japan. I think it is effective and efficient to use these dictionary type book when learning vocaburary becasuse you can learn useful and frequently used expressions without spending a lot of time to read books and watch movies. However, I think learning vocaburary from literatures and master pieces of movies might be more beneficial in the long run, cause you can easily continue the habit to touch the language without feeling efforts and studying. Having said that, I still want to learn commonly used expressions throught the series of dictionary book I have been laerning as the words and idioms I see in the books are really used in daily and business conversations.

* I have been under the weather since Sunday. I think I've got something Covid or Flu from my child. Wondering if there is a data or study that the people who have children are more high rate of infection than the people who don't have any children or partner. I think the thoery that people who have children are more suseptable for infection makes sense for me because they share the same air very long hours and close like when sleeping in the same bed.

* Time Machine is the book I have been reading since I caught a cold. I have read just half of it, but the story was already something different to the general time travel ones. The typical time travel story is related to time paradox, re-do something, multi verse and so on, but the interesting viewpoint of this book is focusing on the future state of human being. How our human kind will evolve is the topic of the book. I can't wait to read the rest of the book.

* Keeping a studying habit in busy state is hard. I tend to skip my habits when I am busy for work bacause I feel like my brain is occupied with it and fully used to sort out the issue I am having. I think this state makes my field of view narrower and may choose short solving choice rather than the solution that could be a good in the long run. I am curious how it happens from phycological perspective, but anyway, I think doing and keeping your hobbies even in busy situation makes you keep your head cool and lead a correct dicisions.

* I am wondering what am I supposed to write. If the topic is too specific for myself and my living, the journal could be very dangerous for me and family because someone might be able to identifying me using the information. I don't mind to be honest disclosing my private as long as it is not too far though. I recommend someone who might watching here that should not take all the thing as gospel as I actually write this diary with some untrue or making up information sometimes. Houwever, the recent chatGPT or kind of generative AI may be able to distinguish my concealment and idenfify some private information even some password or critical and credential information. I need to be careful, but I don't think there is a person who can spend his or her precious time to watch here and put some effort for me. I am just leaving my diary here just to improve my writing skill and sort out my ideas. there is no worth in literatures or reading this.

* I have been to a Korean BBQ restaurant for the first time in this city. WHen I lived in the previous city, there were lots of Korean restaurants and most of them are very affordable compared to other Izakaya style restaurants and tastes very nice. However, the Korean restraunts here is more like a fancy type of food and costs almost more than double than I eat in the past place. It was good that the taste was very nice and I felt nostalgiic though.
* I recently visited a Korean BBQ restaurant for the first time in this city. In my previous city, there were many Korean restaurants, most of which were very affordable compared to other Izakaya-style restaurants and tasted great.

* I wonder why my friend cannot stick to study and achieve a certain level. I admit I am a bit easy to get bored when I reach improvement in a cetain extent. but it seems there are people who can't be reach at that level and nothing achieved.

* introducing myself is a kind of thing that I need to work on more. I always wing it and fail. The little preparation make me feel that self-introduction is difficult. So going forward, I think one strategy to overcome the feeling of weakness is preparing what you say like a template for such a situation meeting people first time. However, I think experiencing and meeting as many people as possible is the fastest way to get used to introducting yourself.

* It is always good to prepare and imagine the things that if you have never experienced that. I felt this today when I drove to the airport with high up people. I don't usually use a toll road, but I needed to use it to get to the airport as soon as possible due to their flight schedule. On my way to pick up them from airport, I took the way as practice, and it turned out that the route was not easy and there were lots of place I need to change the lanes. I ended up driving without any problems, but I might have different result if I haven't prepared and practiced it. Of-course too much of preparation might be a backfire sometimes, but I think it is good to think and image what it is going to be just in case.

* why do people usually say you should be kind to older people? I think they are already out of the way and young people don't have to put lots of efforts to them.

* I have re-started pumping iron since I got a cold last week. I think I am fully recovered and I did dead-lift today.

* We have visited a zoo yesterday. It was kind of a complex place of a zoo and an natural asretchinc facilities. There were lots of animals including some iconic ones in this country and we wanted to take photos there. Unfortunately, the photo taking time was already passed when we got to the place, we ended up getting a free voucher for the next time.

* Recently, I have been trying a call whenever I have a chance in daily life. Today I had two calls, one was to the gym I have been going for almost a year. I wanted to ask them to reissue a gym fob key that I have lost one somewhere on Sunday. The second chance was to ask car servicing center to replace the battery of my car. Whenever I call, I write down the points for the conversation because I am afraid of getting confusing what I want to say. Even my mother tongue, calling is a difficult and a bit of awkward task because you don't want to experience any awkward moment and mis-communications. Although people who get my call might be fiddly to respond as I ask saying again and again sometimes, I think it is the work the people have to do in this country, and good for me to practice real conversation that I cannot do in Japane definitely.

I wanted to ask them to reissue a gym fob key that I lost somewhere on Sunday. The second call was to a car servicing center to replace my car's battery. Whenever I call, I write down the key points of the conversation because I am afraid of getting confused about what I want to say. Even in my mother tongue, making calls is a difficult and somewhat awkward task because you want to avoid any awkward moments or miscommunications. Although the people I call might find it a bit tedious to repeat themselves sometimes, I think it’s part of their job, and it’s good for me to practice real conversations that I definitely cannot do in Japan.

* I saw a youtube video that mentioned listening and reading are essentially the same thing. It was suprising for me that I thought listening is more high level skill than reading. Because you can change speeds and look back when reading, while listening is required to understand the meanings only once and fixed speed. However, it sounded like both ability use the same part of brain as long as the difficulty of meanings are the same. So I think it means that listening and audio books are quite efficient and useful when you cannot look at books like while you are walking, or on tread mill.
* I saw a YouTube video that mentioned listening and reading are essentially the same thing. It was surprising to me because I thought listening was a higher-level skill than reading. With reading, you can change speeds and look back, while with listening, you need to understand the meanings in real-time and at a fixed speed. However, the video explained that both abilities use the same part of the brain, as long as the difficulty of the material is the same. So, I think this means that listening to audiobooks is quite efficient and useful, especially when you cannot look at books, such as while walking or on a treadmill.

* I stil feel that speaking in front of people is difficult and I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach. The reason of this is because I am simply not good at constructing sentences and choosing words correctly regardress in English or Japanese. Another reason is that sometimes I don't understand or I don't concentrate on the things takled. This might be because of fatigue or lack of sleep. It is impossible to concentrate on the everything I see and hear in daily life, however, I need to judge scenes that I have to focus on or not. I think that is something to do with so called Productivity.

* What I really hate my friend is that they alwasy complains around her and doesn't move on a positive side to change it by themselves. I don't think that is a constructive or progressive way to deal with the challenges you face. You need to face the issue and think how you can feel better by figuring out the problems. Your brain is not just to feel sad. What are you thinking and doing? I understand that you can't controll everything and you shouldn't think so, however, there must be someway to solve or avert it. What you have to do is just thinking.

* It was almost a week since I started walking in the morning. I began walking because I wanted to lose fat on my belly and prepare for playing baseball planned in October. I have been gained almost 10kg since last year and I believe half of them are muscles. I watched some youtube videos mentioned walking in the morening before breakfast makes your fat burn efficiently.

* Spark 2 has been rolled out from positive grid few days ago. I didn't have any ideas what it does mean because there are several spark amp models and what model they are talking about. However, it turned out it was about a 40W size amp. It sounded like the biggest change from the previous models is the buit-in looper and drum machine functionalities. Another is having the portability with a special optional battery, which allow to bring your amp to anywhere without static power and play on the street, in a camp site, and so on. I think havbing a built-on drum machine or looper is really useful to practice the guitar alone. I tend to use a looper and rithm machine to practice improvising and small jam, but I need to launch some app and operate the app, and it makes a bit annoying me. Thus, I think the quicker you can start rithms, the more self-motivated and enjoyable you play the guitar.

* I am thinking to buy a smart weight scale that can send the records to a common app of the same brand as the smartwatch I am using. The good thing is that I don't have to open a different app to review my weight and weight is strongly relevant to excercise and the smartwatch is able to log your exciercise and it's best place to review your information of exciercising and weight trend.

* I am sleepy. I gotta go to bed early, but I have to finish my journaling habit before. I started this maybe a month ago, but I relly like this because writing your ideas or thinking somewhere helps you sort out the issues you have and points you have to work on. It takes a little bit time to get used to writing from nowhere, but I am now feeling good and want to continue this.

* I have no idea what to do to imporove my speaking skill in English. I know vocabulary is the all and end of it, and it is important to expose myself touching English countents as much time as possible. As a foreigner living in English speaking country, I already got used to listening and reading contents in English, but I think I have been just numbing or on autopilot without deeply understanding them. People especially adults can easily adopts a new environment using their experiences, but I think children are more suceptible to the change of environment. That is why I think children are more absorbent when it comes to learning a language spoken around them. I believe that writing a journal like this will help imporove my skills in the long run.

However, I feel like I’ve been just going through the motions without deeply understanding them.

* I am gonna talk about the cultural differences between Japan and this country. It is obviouis and easy to say that language, people, culture, and climite are different, but imporatnt thing is how I felt and affectc when it comes to living. Because the environment differences affects your personality, and how you feel is varies depending on the things and people around you. Ok, let's get the ball rolling, the first thing I want to mention is the difference in professionalism. In japan, professional people is like the person is like modest, low-key and very calm, however, in this country, the person who is popular and good reputation is all communicatable and convincible. So communication skill is the start and end of it. Of copuse the knowledge and insightful thinking is also contributing the abvility of communication, but I think behave and talk like professional is one of the skill to make client confortable and want to buy products and sevices from the person.

* You need to put the hard yard when it comes to keeping a study habit. Actually, this journaling is one of study habit for me to work on my english speaking skill, but sometimes I feel fiddly to consider and write. However, I think this is the only habit that I can express and output the things I am anxious or want to express. I believe this is good way to sort out my ideas and want to continue.
*  I find it difficult
* articulate the things
* continue it

* I am fed up with my friend attitude not to learn anything around him. He basically doens't know knowledges and skills are created by a tiny study habit that is different to the way to study when we were students. You are the only one who needs to find time and how you use the precious time to study. You can't have enoght chunk of time to sit down in the desk, while you have to use up your time like listening audio book while you are washing the dishes. There must be some time you can spare to study, and what you have to do is throwing away smartphones and watching cheap youtube videos, and just start something very easy things but related to study. You will be able to accumulate small effort, but it is going to be a huge pile of skills and experiences for you.

* Listening is more efficient way to remember vocaburary rather than just reading. I think it is because our brain is more sensitive of sound of words genetically due to the long history of human language. Some people argued that people have been speaking since they became a "human" for over millions years ago(maybe I don't know when the first human emerged), but the letters and wrting systems invented quite a recent years(maybe within 3000 years?). So our brain and the part of it related to communication shoudl be designed to listen and make sounds, not for writing and reading. Thus, I believe listening sound and getting exporse yourself into the contents listening is good way to learn vocaburary. 
* more sensitive to the sounds of words
* for millions of years
* quite recently
* designed more for listening and making sounds than for writing and reading

* This morning, I ended up going to the gym without my smartphone because I forgot to set it on the charger last night. I usually browsing news and watch youtube videos while walking on the treadmil for about 25mins, but I didn't have the tool to enjoy contents this morning. I though I may have bring my laptop to listen to music or radio, but I didn't do that because it obviously looked silly. So I ended up talking myself without making any sound, and it was really good for me to practice speaking. The first several minutes are a bit awkward to speak by myself wondering what to say and to choose correct words, but I found myself can speak comparatebely smooth and fluent. I experienced the same feeling when I had nothing to do in the U.S. and suffered to sleep due to jet lag. So talking myself might be a worth a shot if I feel I am stambling choosing words and expressions.

* Today I had an internal learning session meeting organizing myself to teach how to use new system to some team members. I felt I could deliver at least some basics of them, though I feel I went a bit off the topic sometimes. It is quite difficult to teach stuff people, but I think the most important thing is enjoying talking to what you want to tell. Without enjoying the presentation, you will not be able to deliver the value and essense efficiently since the lister feel your nerves feelings and take your saying with a grain of salt. You have to enjoy talking when it comes to speaking and presenting in front of people.
* Today, I had an internal learning session where I organized myself to teach some team members how to use the new system. I felt I could deliver at least the basics, although I did go off-topic a few times. Teaching can be quite challenging, but I believe the most important thing is to enjoy sharing what you want to communicate. If you don't enjoy the presentation, you won't be able to deliver the value and essence effectively, as the listeners will sense your nervousness and may not take your words seriously. Enjoying the act of speaking is crucial when it comes to presenting in front of people.

* I am losing my confidence for work a bit because of my poor time management and productivity. I am easily get interested in anything and it causing off the track sometimes. I have a habit to write down my task list and priority to address, but it is easiliy distructed by ideas popping up on my head. It is a good thing and enjoy that connect a dot and another dot to draw line. I need double or triple time to do all the things I want to do.

* My colleague said that he has been offered a job from one of our customer, but he said he will turn down it due to the location of the office. I think it is not a suprising thing in this country to offer a job among relationships, but it made me thinking on the future a bit. I would like to keep this kind of job in the long haul and have some experiences, but I need to organize a lot of things in Japan before I really start working this country like pensions, stocks, bank accounts, and visa. I believe I am a bit lack of points when it comes to applying permanent resident visa, so I need some time to get it. Either way, learning english is the first and all of the future of my life. I will work on and hard on it.
* My colleague mentioned that he was offered a job by one of our clients, but he said he would turn it down due to the office location. I don’t think it’s surprising in this country for job offers to come through personal connections, but it did make me think about the future. I’d like to stay in this type of job for the long term and gain more experience, but I need to take care of a lot of things in Japan before I can fully commit to working here, such as pensions, stocks, bank accounts, and my visa. I believe I might be lacking in some areas when it comes to applying for a permanent resident visa, so I’ll need some time to prepare for that. In any case, learning English is my top priority, and it will shape the future of my life. I’m committed to working hard on it.
