* Normally, on country roads, if you see a radar gun as you keep going along, you flash your headlights to the oncoming cars. "Just so you know", they could pin you up there. I feel like there is a type of flash they should be doing. Bec, did this: flash-flash. and I'm this flash pause flash. I think I go with Bec. really? that seems panicky. no. the whole point of this is, it's conspiratorial. like the same way that you do a quick wink to someone if it's 'message received' and it's fast. That's how pros do it. Going up to someone doing slow wink, that's how babies do it. Unfortunately, you do it a really weird way that no one agrees with it. If you did long flashes and I was oncoming, I would think you're tyring to turn on your lights and you don't know how. I'd think you're brand new to the car.
